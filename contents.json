The\nUnited States countered\nin August, when acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reportedly\nsuggested a US reactor\nwould be operational on the Moon by 2030.\nWhile it might feel like a sudden sprint, this isn’t exactly breaking news.

    "source": "Chowdeck\n, a Lagos-based food delivery startup that has stayed profitable in a\nnotoriously tough and low-margin market\n, has raised $9 million in Series A funding to launch a quick commerce strategy and expand into more cities in Nigeria and Ghana.\nThe equity round was led by Novastar Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator, AAIC Investment, Rebel Fund, GFR Fund, Kaleo, HoaQ, and others. The investors are betting on the team’s ability to pair local market expertise with execution and turn a notoriously difficult sector into a profitable super app for food, groceries and essentials.\n“We’re thrilled about this round as it brings us closer to our vision of becoming Africa’s number one super app,” CEO and co-founder\nFemi Aluko\nsaid. “This funding will supercharge our growth plans, enabling us to expand into more cities, reduce delivery times, scale our grocery footprint, and attract the best talent to drive innovation and customer satisfaction.”\nFounded in October 2021 by Aluko,\nOlumide Ojo\n, and\nLanre Yusuf\n, Chowdeck now operates in 11 cities across Nigeria and Ghana, serving 1.5 million customers with a network of more than 20,000 riders. Its logistics system averages 30 minutes per order, and in dense areas, more than half of deliveries arrive by bicycle.\nWhile prominent players have exited or scaled back their African operations, Chowdeck has leaned into the complexity of local markets—delivering local meals, an operationally harder challenge—to build trust with customers.\nIn 2024, the value of meals delivered through Chowdeck grew more than sixfold from the previous year. This year, the company says it passed its 2024 total before July.\nThe new funding will help Chowdeck roll out quick commerce, ultra-fast delivery backed by a network of dark stores and hyperlocal logistics hubs. The company plans to open 40 dark stores by the end of this year and 500 by the end of 2026, with two to three new stores launching each week. Chowdeck\nraised a $2.5 million\nseed round last year.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

In Europe,\nGorillas and Getir\nburned through hundreds of millions of dollars before retreating or consolidating. In India, platforms like\nBlinkit\n,\nZepto\nand\nSwiggy\nhave had varying levels of success with the model when it comes to profitability.\nChowdeck has been profitable since before this raise and Aluko says the company doesn’t enter cities or verticals without planning to break even within a couple of weeks.\nFor instance, the food delivery platform\nentered neighbouring Ghana this May\n. Within three months,\nit was handling 1,000 daily orders\nwithout paid advertising, which, according to Aluko, came from pent-up demand for a service that delivers local favorites alongside international cuisines. The company aims to quintuple that volume to 5,000 daily orders by the end of September 2025.\nAluko says Chowdeck plans to apply the same playbook to dark stores, which will complement its restaurant and grocery delivery operations.\nAnother vertical complementing these operations will be software. This June,\nthe YC-backed startup acquired Mira\n, a point-of-sale provider for African food and hospitality businesses. Mira’s tools manage inventory and orders in real time; now, it will help Chowdeck optimize its operations, positioning the company as a vertical SaaS-plus-logistics provider for restaurants.\nChowdeck’s raise is a win for local players in the sector,\nafter Jumia’s exit\nleft market share to foreign brands such as Glovo, Bolt Food, and Yango. Yet,\nsome of these companies\nhave also withdrawn\nfrom certain markets\n, including Nigeria and Ghana, which Chowdeck is now targeting aggressively.\nSuper apps such as Gozem, YC-backed\nYassir\n, and\nMNT-Halan\nare other local companies offering food delivery services in other African markets.\n“The market is still very early,” Aluko said. “Customer behavior is shifting online for the first time. A whole generation is growing up ordering food without ever having walked into some of the restaurants or markets on our platform.”\nFor lead investor Novastar Ventures, the bet is on execution and local insight. “Chowdeck is building the future of logistics for African cities,” said partner Brian Waswani Odhiambo. “With deep local insight, a sustainability-first approach, and impressive execution, it is redefining last-mile delivery on the continent.”\nNigeria’s YC-backed Chowdeck hopes to scale food delivery, a notoriously tough market, with $2.5M funding\nTopics\nAfrica\n,\nChowdeck\n,\nfood apps\n,\nfood delivery\n,\nnigeria food delivery\n,\nStartups\nTage Kene-Okafor\nReporter, Africa\nTage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

Now, in the digital world, heists look starkly different and\ncybersecurity\nthreats are constant, with banks like NatWest facing a “continuous arms race” with around 100 million cyber-attacks every month. What used to be gangs of robbers digging tunnels and smuggling deposit boxes full of cash are now groups of hackers sending phishing emails and holding some of the most notable companies to ransom for hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThis transition from physical to digital theft is evident. No longer confined to vaults and getaway cars, today's high-stake heists are executed remotely, by online threat actors. These modern-day criminals operate across borders, targeting vulnerabilities in systems and human behavior to extract data and money. The sheer volume and relentless nature of these digital assaults, as exemplified by financial institutions battling millions of cyber-attacks monthly, highlight a new era of crime.\nAndy Syrewicze\nSocial Links Navigation\nSecurity Evangelist at Hornetsecurity.\nThe growing problem of cyber-attacks\nCyber-attacks are a growing problem, amongst a growing number of sectors, and confronting this escalating issue is vital. It’s not just banks that are facing the constant threat of cyber-attacks; cyber threats are growing at an exponential rate, while becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted.\nYou may like\nWhy burnout is one of the biggest threats to your security\nThe Human Firewall: even with AI, humans are still the last line of defense in cybersecurity\nSMBs remain easy pickings for cybercriminals - here’s why\nData breaches have hit a myriad of industries: from luxury brands like Dior and supermarkets like M&S, to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and UK government organization Legal Aid.\nThe dangers to personal data are being felt across all sectors, at all digital touchpoints. Amid this battleground of immediate cyber threats comes a growing demand for robust\nsecurity\nsolutions that address company concerns.\nFrom advanced\nantivirus\ntechnologies to endpoint\nbackup software\n, AI-powered security is evolving rapidly to stay ahead of such attacks - and it’s essential that companies invest in these defenses in order to stay more than one step ahead.\nEvolution of technology\nAs technology evolves at a rapid pace, companies must keep up with advancements made by cyber-attackers. As businesses of all sizes continue to embrace digital transformation, the need to strengthen their cybersecurity grows increasingly critical.\nAre you a pro?

This Code of Practice and governance framework package guides boards and directors in managing digital risks and safeguarding their businesses and organizations from cyberattacks.\nThe framework encourages companies to take four employee-focused actions: foster a cybersecurity culture; ensure clear policies support a positive cybersecurity culture; improve their own cyber literacy through training; and use suitable metrics to verify the organization has an effective cybersecurity training, education, and awareness program.\nThe report is a clear reminder that the human\nfirewall\n, that is, the employees who encounter an attack and respond, is just as important as technological defenses.\nMore than a simple fix, a culture shift is needed\nIt’s not enough to roll out generic training. The reality is that in today’s world, one wrong click can bring a business to a complete halt. According to the latest insights, the approximate amount of ransoms paid globally in 2024 reached $813.55 million.\nWhen requested to pay a ransom, companies know that refusing to do so runs the risk of their customers’ personal information being leaked publicly, which would additionally require them to pay the associated financial penalties and legal payouts, not to mention reputational damage.\nAddressing the threat of cyber-attacks must be embedded in a company’s culture, given the fact that if threat actors are successful, the impact of their actions would be felt not only company-wide but also by the ecosystem within which the organization operates.\nLeadership and security\nOrganizations can bolster their security by cultivating strong leadership, providing tailored training, and building a proactive security culture to create a ‘human firewall’ of colleagues armed with know-how.\nEmployees\nof all skillsets and seniorities should undergo comprehensive and ongoing cyber awareness training, whatever their role and seniority, to drive the defenses forward and cultivate a mindful culture.\nWhen employees are provided with the knowledge and tools to maintain awareness of the dangers their company is facing, they can be the most effective method to keep the business secure.\nBuilding a mindful culture\nBuilding a mindful culture can be complemented by a Zero Trust approach, which creates a robust defense against evolving cyber threats. This strategic approach mandates rigorous verification for all access requests, irrespective of their origin or the user's location within the network, thereby yielding exceptionally strong results that effectively eliminate a significant portion of potential threats.\nFor example, when an employee receives an email requesting sensitive information or a link to a suspicious\nwebsite\n, they should be trained to recognize it as a potential phishing attempt right away, verify the sender's identity, and report the email to the IT department for further investigation.\nThis proactive stance, ingrained through a Zero Trust philosophy and continuous education, significantly reduces the likelihood of successful breaches. It’s better safe than sorry, and in the realm of cybersecurity, this means being diligent about taking the extra steps to fortify an organization's digital defenses.\nDon't stop at basic protections\nDon't stop at basic protections, make ongoing training a priority. Defenses can’t stop at antivirus technology and\nendpoint protection\n, and training isn’t a one-time solution. While these are the necessities, they are simply not enough for the twenty-first century heist as businesses continue to battle millions of cyber-attacks each month.\nAs threats advance or teams become complacent, ongoing phishing simulations, tests and education are key in maintaining a robust human firewall. Companies must invest in technology and ongoing training to equip employees across all roles and levels with the skills and awareness to stay alert. A company’s greatest weapon can be its workforce, if leveraged.\nCybersecurity needs tech, but it's nothing without people who are well trained to understand the latest attack methods and protect against the digital transition's inherent risks.\nWe list the best ransomware protection\n.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

But we’re a few months into the console’s lifecycle now and there are a variety of Switch 2-only games that are worth your cash, as well as a bunch of original Switch games that have received improvements for the new console And there’s also a robust selection of third-party games that have been on other consoles for a while, but not available on the Switch.\nBetween all those, there are plenty of good games for the Switch 2 — and if you don’t have an original Switch, there’s even more out there. You can see\nour list of our favorite Switch games here\n, but this list will focus on Switch 2 exclusives, original Switch games that have been improved for the new hardware and the best-performing, third-party titles worth your time. And keep an eye on this list, as there should be a lot more Switch 2 exclusives coming this fall that we're excited to try, including eagerly-awaited titles like\nMetroid Prime 4\n.\nQuick Overview\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nMario Kart World\nMore options\n$79 at Amazon\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nMore options\n$67 at Amazon\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition\nMore options\n$69 at Amazon\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition\nMore options\n$79 at Amazon\nFast Fusion\n$15 at GameStop\nSee 4 more\nBest Nintendo Switch 2 games for 2025\nNintendo\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nMario Kart World\nMario Kart World\nisn’t quite the\nreinvention\nof the massively popular franchise that I thought it might be based on Nintendo’s extensive preview of the game. No matter. Mario Kart is a proven formula, and Nintendo has done more than enough to make\nMKW\nthe kind of game that millions of people will play over the next decade or so. There are a ton of cleverly-designed new tracks that you can pick up and play immediately — but the more time you put into them, the more shortcuts and secrets you’ll find to help master them. There’s a truckload of Nintendo characters to pilot your kart or bike, from the heavy hitters to bizarre but amusing choices like a Piranha plant. And there are beefed-up multiplayer and sharing features powered by GameChat on the Switch 2.\nBut while\nMario Kart World\nwill feel familiar to the millions who played\nMario Kart 8\n, it also introduces a few noteworthy new features. One is that the majority of courses don’t have you doing three laps around a track — instead, you’re driving from point A to point B, with every track being set in a part of a larger world (hence the name). And there’s an open-world mode where you’re not in a race. You can cruise from one side of the map to the other, looking for little bonus challenges, unlocking more outfits for your characters and finding other collectibles. There are hundreds of P-Switch challenges and dozens of Peach medallions and question mark boxes you can track down. The fact that you can’t cruise around free roam in multiplayer mode is a major bummer, and the world itself feels somewhat deserted as a result, but there’s still a ton to do here.\nThe open-world nature of the game also enables a new race type: Knockout mode. This is probably my favorite part — it’s an ongoing race across six courses with five checkpoints along the way. At each checkpoint, you have to be higher than a certain ranking or you’ll be eliminated. Being in the top 20 out of 24 total racers at the first checkpoint isn’t so tough, but obviously the challenge grows as the field is trimmed. Knockout mode is a great combo of a more traditional Grand Prix style race with a longer, world-crossing sprint to the finish. While I wish Nintendo took just a few more risks with\nMario Kart World,\nit’s the kind of game anyone can pick up and have a blast with.\n— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor\n$79 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$80 at Macy's\n$80 at Target\nNintendo\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nNintendo hasn’t made a 3D Donkey Kong platformer since 1999, but\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nis\nmore than worth the wait\n. I’d argue that it’s the first must-buy title for the Switch 2 and the most compelling reason to buy Nintendo’s latest console as soon as you can. It takes a delightful gaming mechanic (smashing nearly everything you can get your fists on) and builds a huge variety of engaging experiences around it. At first, I was worried I’d get tired of all the smashing, but the wide variety of different worlds and challenges keep things continuously fresh. The Bananza powers you pick up throughout the game definitely help with that, too — you can power up DK so his smashes are more potent, or transform into a speedy zebra to dash through obstacles or an ostrich that can float above them.\nThere’s also more story to the game than I expected, centering on DK and the 13-year-old girl Pauline who accompanies him through most of his adventures. She’s a charming sidekick and her love of singing is what helps DK unlock the aforementioned Bananza powers. The game is also absolutely gorgeous and visually stunning, with each world having a completely different vibe from the one that came before it — but they’re all wonderfully rendered. The music rules, too. Pauline’s songs are catchier than they have any right to be, and I had them stuck in my head long after I put the game down.\nDonkey Kong Bananaza\nis, quite simply, Nintendo at its best.\n— N.I.\n$67 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Macy's\n$70 at Target\nNintendo\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition\nAs a launch title for the original Switch,\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nwas a massive critical and commercial success for Nintendo. It shook up the formula the series had largely stuck to for decades, gave players a massive version of Hyrule to explore and an endless variety of ways to tackle the game’s challenges. But even when it came out in 2017, it was clear that\nBreath of the Wild\nwas pushing the Switch’s modest hardware to the limit. Framerates could often drop below 30, the game maxed out at 1080p resolution and load times were rather long.\nFor\nBreath of the Wild\naficionados and new players alike, the Switch 2 edition of this classic is definitely worth your time. The framerate is essentially locked at 60fps and that makes a massive difference in how fluid the game feels. It can also run in up to 4K resolution when the Switch 2 is docked. And while the game’s art style is such that extreme fidelity isn’t always obvious, there’s no doubt it looks better overall. Faster load times when jumping in and out of shrines is also a major quality of life upgrade.\nOne of the coolest things about\nBreath of the Wild\nfor the Switch 2 is the companion Zelda Notes tool. It’s part of the Switch smartphone app and lets you do things like turn on navigation to find shrines and other landmarks around Hyrule, as well as fun tidbits like voice memories for various locations and daily bonuses like free meals or weapon durability restores. The Switch 2 edition of\nBreath of the Wild\nis a $10 upgrade if you own the base game, but it’s free for anyone who subscribes to the $50 / year Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Park service.\n— N.I.\n$69 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Target\n$90 at Macy's\nNintendo\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition\nWith\nTears of the Kingdom\n, Nintendo managed to follow up the reinvention of the Zelda series with a game that added more to discover and more to play with, and it even throws in a mystical LEGO kit. Link soon discovers Ultrahand, which lets you grab and stick objects, batteries, engines, weapons, food (and more) to other objects. It’s the standout addition compared to its predecessor; a creative toolbox of solutions (or foolish endeavors) to solve every puzzle, fight every beast and explore every part of\nTears of the Kingdom.\nThe Switch 2 edition adds the sort of improvements and upgrades that, arguably, warrant paying to upgrade your Switch edition. To start with, I struggled to make the frame rates choke in my current playthrough. On the original Switch, the gorgeous world of Hyrule would often stutter and slow as you transitioned between sky, surface and underground. The game’s framerates would peak at 30fps, while busy moments (or lots of custom building) could knock those rates severely.\nOn the Switch 2,\nToTK\nruns at 60fps, locked. It plays smoothly, pretty much all the time, and it’s a big improvement to what is still a beautiful adventure. The new hardware adds HDR to the graphics. This expanded dynamic range comes into its own in the underground depths sections, the low-light areas a little clearer and easier to navigate. No surprise: loading times are also quicker when fast travelling and loading the game initially.\nThere are also gameplay quality-of-life upgrades, including audio logs you can discover and listen to on the companion smartphone app and the ability to both store and share your items, weapons and ingredients. If your favorite part was crafting spinning laser death machines, et al, with your Ultrahand, the ability to save builds as QR codes and share with friends is a fun addition, if a little limited in utility at the start. You will have to manually scour the internet for creations from people who aren’t on your friends list.\nThat limitation aside, the Switch 2 edition delivers plenty for that $10 upgrade charge – and Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass subscribers get both\nToTK\nand\nBoTW\nupgrades for free.\n— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief\n$79 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$80 at Target\n$80 at Best Buy\nShin'en Multimedia\nFast Fusion\nFast Fusion\nis a sci-fi arcade racer that wears its influences proudly. It loves\nWipeout\nand the 3D\nF-Zero\ngames, and it wants little more than to bring their ideas into modern times. Fortunately, those games ruled, so there are much worse inspirations to rip from.\nThe key to\nFast Fusion\nis right in the title: It is seriously fast, and it commits to that feeling of speed with every choice it makes. Whooshing lines drag from the back of your hard-angled ship, its engine wheezing, the background perpetually blurred. You and your opponents cut through the air like hands out the window of a speeding car. Gloriously, you can jump, sometimes skipping turns entirely, other times launching yourself into a fiery wreck. An\nIkaruga\n-esque mechanic has you quickly match the color of your craft to the many boost pads littered around each course, and there’s a boost meter you can keep topped up by taking the right line through a given section. Do it all right, and you can complete whole races without ever slowing down. Miss a few, and you’re playing a game of resource management at 500 miles per hour.\nThere’s pretty much no continuity between each track: One race you’re dashing through a forest like it’s\nReturn of the Jedi\n; the next you’re dodging tornadoes on a stormy highway. But they are spectacles, and crucially, they give you the space to maintain your speed, with few super-tight turns thrown in your way. When there is an obstacle to dodge — a giant rotating fan, crashing logs — you tend to just whiz by, furthering the sense of walking a tightrope. It all adds up to a racer that, like its spiritual predecessors, keeps you constantly engaged. For $15, it’s a pretty good deal too. Just note that there’s no online multiplayer. —\nJeff Dunn, Senior Reporter\n$15 at GameStop\nNintendo\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nWith\nDK taking center stage in the Switch 2's first AAA platformer\n, that means we're going to have to wait a bit longer for a new mainline Mario game (\nMario Kart World\ndoesn't count). But you know that? That's ok, because\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nis still an all-time great title even among an already star-studded franchise.\nIt has one of the best soundtracks of any Mario game (\nJump Up, Super Star\nanyone?) and some of the wildest mechanics. You want to turn Mario into a T-Rex? Sure, why not? How about a Hammer Bro or a Goomba? You got it — and that's just the start. And with levels that will take you from the city to an edible wonderland, there's no shortage of places to explore. So if somehow you've managed to skip\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nand are looking to play one of the best 3D platformers ever made, picking this up for the Switch 2 is a no-brainer. And did we mention it runs better on Nintendo's latest console, too?\n— Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter\n$42 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$59 at Macy's\n$60 at Target\nNintendo\nPokémon Scarlet & Pokémon Violet\nSome might have issues with its rigid level scaling or certain areas feeling a bit empty, but if\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet\nhad come out on the Switch 2 instead of the original Switch, Nintendo could have completely sidestepped one of the title's biggest issues: lackluster performance. But thanks to a free update pack for Nintendo's latest console, the game runs beautifully. Framerates are higher and more stable, draw distance is farther, monster density has been increased and textures and visuals have been optimized across the board. This is how the game was meant to be experienced all along and with an open world format, three different main storylines and over 100 new Pokémon to encounter,\nScarlet and Violet\nfeels like it's gotten a second life on the Switch 2.\n— S.R.\n$120 at Macy's\nExplore More Buying Options\n$120 at Target\n$127 at Amazon\nIO Interactive\nHitman: World of Assassination\nWorld of Assassination\nis how the\nHitman\nseries packaged together three meaty entries in the death-dealing series, with online limited-run events, celebrities and even an eventual Bond tie-in. Is it the best, smoothest way to play Hitman? No, but while the frame-rate dips when you‘re blending into the crowds at Formula 1, or hiding away in at the fashion show, it’s playable and it looks good. It’s also a good indication of the leap between the two Switch consoles: The original games ran on the Switch, but demanded cloud streaming.\nIO Interactive put so much attention into building compelling sandbox levels, and you’ll really live in stages like Dartmoor as you figure out the most delightful ways to end your target. Also: there are so many disguises.\nIf you thought three games in one is a lot, this is also the Signature Edition, which folds in even more content, levels and missions. There’s a lot to play through and if, like me, you never quite finished the trilogy, this is a portable, convenient way to wrap up Agent 47’s saga. It also gives the studio plenty of time to refine performance on the Switch 2 ahead of its big Bond title,\n007 First Light. — M.S.\n$60 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$60 at Target\n$64 at Macy's\nCD Projekt\nCyberpunk 2077\nCyberpunk 2077\ncertainly isn't the newest game on this list, but the idea of porting this game over to the original Switch and its outdated hardware is so laughable, CD Projekt Red probably didn't even try. But that's what makes seeing it run on the Switch 2 so impressive. Sure, if you do some serious pixel peeping, you might notice where some graphics don't look quite as good as they would on a high-end PC or PS5. But getting the game to run as smoothly as it does on a system that you can bring pretty much anywhere is no small feat. Plus, the Ultimate Edition version of the game includes the Phantom Liberty expansion, which means you'll have well over a hundred hours of sci-fi RPG ruckus to engage in.\n— S.R.\n$69 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Best Buy\nCheck out our entire\nBest Games series\nincluding the\nbest Nintendo Switch games\n, the\nbest PS5 games\n, the\nbest Xbox games\n, the\nbest PC games\nand the\nbest free games\nyou can play today.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",

    "source": "In 2025, the average urban Indian no longer needs to wait very long for much (except at government offices and in traffic): They simply have to order what they need from an app, and it’ll be delivered within minutes. The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes. It seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days. It was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round. The new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago. The startup now has bookings numbering in the ‘four-digits’ every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures. Pronto founder and CEO Anjali Sardana with workers Image Credits: Pronto ‘It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,’ Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round. For investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. ‘We were very impressed by Anjali’s clarity of thought and execution,’ said Anand Chandrasekaran, a partner at General Catalyst, in a prepared statement. ‘The market for at-home services is massive but also very nuanced. We believe that Anjali and the team have the right vision and approach to build a generational company in this space.’",

So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders. Building TD AI Bosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team.

    "summary": "Sam Altman is in the process of co-founding a new brain-to-computer interface startup called Merge Labs and raising funds for it with the capital possibly coming largely from OpenAI’s ventures team, unnamed sources\ntold the Financial Times\n.\nThe startup is expected to be valued at $850 million. A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.\nMerge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.\nMerge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t\nknown until 2017\n) and the company has made serious progress.\nNeuralink is\ncurrently in trials\nwith people who suffer from severe paralysis.

    "source": "Russia’s\nAPT28\nis actively deploying LLM-powered malware against Ukraine, while underground platforms are selling the same capabilities to anyone for $250 per month.\nLast month,\nUkraine’s CERT-UA\ndocumented\nLAMEHUG\n, the first confirmed deployment of LLM-powered malware in the wild. The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.\nCato Networks’\nresearcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.\nMost startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.\nThe rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the\n2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report\nreveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers\nobserve\nin the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare\nResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the\nQwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model\n.\nThe legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (Додаток.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\nAPT28’s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of “curly naked women” as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.\nThe provocative image generation prompts used by APT28’s image.py variant, including ‘Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face’, are designed to occupy victims’ attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n“Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,” explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. “This is the first in the wild that was captured.”\nA quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware\nSimonovich’s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28’s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.\nThe method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\n“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'”\nSix hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.\nWelcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy\nDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.\nTo explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.\nAnother platform,\nNytheon AI\n, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”\nThese aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer\n“Claude Code”\nclones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.\nEnterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface\nCato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.\nSimonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.\nWhen Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:\nDeepSeek never responded\nGoogle declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples\nMicrosoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work\nOpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further\nSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.\nThe metrics are stark\n—270\nstolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms\noffer identical capabilities for\n$250 per month\n. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.\nEnterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per\nCato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report\n. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.\nSimonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it’s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.\nToday’s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they’re called productivity tools.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.\nThe Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA's live launch webcast below.\nThe Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA's new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.\nNow, ULA is poised to begin ticking off a backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches the company has sold to commercial and government customers. The new rocket's largest users, by far, will be Amazon and the US Space Force.\nNew and improved\n\"We're excited to see this mission launch,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA's vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This will be the most powerful Vulcan yet.\"\nThe first two Vulcan test flights last year used a configuration of the rocket with two strap-on boosters to add an extra burst of speed off the launch pad. For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters\nfell off the launcher\nmoments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.\nThe setback contributed to the delay of the Space Force's first operational flight with the Vulcan rocket from the end of last year until now. Engineers determined that a carbon composite insulator, or heat shield, inside the nozzle failed to protect the nozzle's metallic structure from the superheated exhaust coming from the booster. Investigators traced the cause of the failure to a \"manufacturing defect\" in one of the insulators, which led to the melting and burn-through of the booster nozzle.\nThe rest of the Vulcan rocket performed close to perfection on the two test flights last year, including the vehicle's BE-4 main engines supplied by Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos. Two BE-4s fly on each Vulcan rocket, consuming cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen for the first five minutes of flight.\nSpace Force officials formally\ncertified the Vulcan rocket\nfor national security launches in March, setting the stage for Tuesday's launch of the USSF-106 mission.\nUnited Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, is one of two companies approved to launch the Pentagon's most expensive and sensitive satellites. SpaceX is the other one, and that company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets have overtaken ULA's launch vehicles, thanks largely to booster reuse. Vulcan, like ULA's legacy Atlas and Delta rockets, is currently designed for a single use. Eventually, ULA aims to recover and reuse the BE-4 engines themselves, but not the entire Vulcan core stage.\nThis will be the third flight of ULA's Vulcan rocket, but the first to fly in a configuration with four solid-fueled boosters.\nCredit:\n          \n          United Launch Alliance\nDespite its higher cost and unproven capability, the Vulcan rocket won the lion's share of US military launch contracts from 2020 through 2024, while SpaceX received a bit less than half of the launch orders the Pentagon put up for competition between the two providers. The balance shifted with a new round of launch contracts awarded in April, with SpaceX becoming the military's leading launch provider and ULA taking second place. Blue Origin also won the right to receive a handful of military launch contracts with its New Glenn rocket, which debuted in January.\nThe Vulcan rocket checks off several important boxes for the Space Force. First, it relies entirely on US-made rocket engines. The Atlas V rocket it is replacing uses Russian-built main engines, and given the chilled relations between the two powers, US officials have long desired to stop using Russian engines to power the Pentagon's satellites into orbit. Second, ULA says the Vulcan rocket will eventually provide a heavy-lift launch capability at a lower cost than the company's now-retired Delta IV Heavy rocket.\nThird, Vulcan provides the Space Force with an alternative to SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, which have been the only rockets in their class available to the military since the last national security mission was launched on an Atlas V rocket one year ago.\nCol. Jim Horne, mission director for the USSF-106 launch, said this flight marks a \"pretty historic point in our program's history.\nWe officially end our reliance on Russian-made main engines with this launch, and we continue to maintain our assured access to space with at least two independent rocket service companies that we can leverage to get our capabilities on orbit.\"\nWhat’s onboard?\nThe Space Force has only acknowledged one of the satellites aboard the USSF-106 mission, but there are more payloads cocooned inside the Vulcan rocket's fairing.\nThe $250 million mission that officials are willing to talk about is named Navigation Technology Satellite-3, or NTS-3. This experimental spacecraft will test new satellite navigation technologies that may eventually find their way on next-generation GPS satellites. A key focus for engineers who designed and will operate the NTS-3 satellite is to look at ways of overcoming GPS jamming and spoofing, which can degrade satellite navigation signals used by military forces, commercial airliners, and civilian drivers.\n\"We're going to be doing, we anticipate, over 100 different experiments,\" said Joanna Hinks, senior research aerospace engineer at the Air Force Research Laboratory's space vehicles directorate, which manages the NTS-3 mission. \"Some of the major areas we’re looking at—we have an electronically steerable phased array antenna so that we can deliver higher power to get through interference to the location that it's needed.\"\nArlen Biersgreen, then-program manager for the NTS-3 satellite mission at the Air Force Research Laboratory, presents a one-third scale model of the NTS-3 spacecraft to an audience in 2022.\nCredit:\n          \n          US Air Force/Andrea Rael\nGPS jamming is especially a problem in and near war zones. Investigators probing the crash of\nAzerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243\nlast December determined GPS jamming, likely by Russian military forces attempting to counter a Ukrainian drone strike, interfered with the aircraft's navigation as it approached its destination in the Russian republic of Chechnya. Azerbaijani government officials blamed a Russian surface-to-air missile for damaging the aircraft, ultimately leading to a crash in nearby Kazakhstan that killed 38 people.\n\"We have a number of different advanced signals that we’ve designed,\" Hinks said. \"One of those is the Chimera anti-spoofing signal... to protect civil users from spoofing that’s affecting so many aircraft worldwide today, as well as ships.\"\nThe NTS-3 spacecraft, developed by L3Harris and Northrop Grumman, only takes up a fraction of the Vulcan rocket's capacity. The satellite weighs less than 3,000 pounds (about 1,250 kilograms), about a quarter of what this version of the Vulcan rocket can deliver to geosynchronous orbit.\nHorne demurred when asked about what else the Vulcan rocket will deploy in orbit: \"\nI’ll just say that any other further details beyond NTS-3 are not releasable to the public, and leave it at that...\nWe’re not going to make any further comments on anything beyond NTS-3 in the mission stack.\"\nThe Space Force's refusal to disclose any information about additional payloads on the USSF-106 mission, even the total number of satellites aboard Vulcan, is somewhat of an outlier compared to the way military officials have historically handled these questions. While the Space Force has consistently kept secret details about specific maneuvers and instruments (or in some cases,\npotential weapons\n), officials have named and numbered the payloads carried aboard nearly all recent national security launches.\nThis is in contrast to the National Reconnaissance Office, which owns the US government's fleet of spy satellites. The NRO has nearly always followed a stricter protocol of secrecy than the Air Force or Space Force.\nThat changed last year, when a classified Space Force mission named USSF-51 launched on an Atlas V rocket. Military leaders didn't disclose the mission's purpose or how many satellites it was carrying until the Space Force officially cataloged three payloads from the launch in its publicly accessible list of all human-made objects in orbit.\nSome of the Space Force's most secret satellites have the ability to release smaller spacecraft themselves, adding to the uncertainty for potential adversaries. Some information about the payloads on Tuesday's launch might become public as the Space Force adds them to the public catalog, and a network of amateur skywatchers on Earth stands ready to observe their movements thousands of miles overhead.\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\nIt used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable\nWatch SE\n(now in its\nsecond generation\n) and, in 2022, the rugged\nApple Watch Ultra\n(also now in its\nsecond generation\n). Suddenly, there are\nlots\nof options.\nNow that\nthe Series 10\nhas been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS,\nwatchOS 11\n, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of\nwatchOS 26\n, which is slated to arrive in the fall.\nWhat we’re looking for\nHow we test Apple Watches\nCollapse\nApple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life.\nWho is it for?\nCollapse\nWe’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs.\nPrice\nCollapse\nShould you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year.\nFeature set\nCollapse\nDo you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you?\nLTE or GPS\nCollapse\nSome scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS.\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024,\nno longer have this feature\n. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)\nWhat about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an\nFDA-cleared sleep apnea detection\nfeature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to\nbasically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market\n— and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.\nIn this article\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\nWhat’s coming next\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\nThe Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.\nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.\nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.\nPolished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It’s quite fetching.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nAs for straps, we recommend the\nnylon sport loop\n, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.\nRelated\nHere are the best Apple Watch deals right now\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPad to buy\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the\nTrail Loop\n, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our\nfitness tracker buying guide\n.\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Series 10\n$\n299\n$\n399\n25\n% off\n$\n299\nThe Good\nBigger display but not bulky\nWide-angle OLED is neat\nMuch faster charging\nSleep apnea detection has potential\nThe Bad\nLack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans\nAnother year of minor updates\n$299 at Amazon\n$299 at Walmart\n$299 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThe latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWe recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\nThe Series 10 focuses on making the watch more readable and comfortable to wear.\nphoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\nRelated\nApple Watch Series 10 review: an Ultra sleek package\nApple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 review: small but smart improvements\nThe Apple Watch SE is a first-time buyer’s smartwatch\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees.\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n$\n169\n$\n249\n32\n% off\n$\n169\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$169 at Amazon\n$169 at Walmart\n$169 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nTo be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will\nnot\nbe able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the\nbiggest risk factors for AFib\nare advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker.\nYou can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n$\n650\n$\n799\n19\n% off\n$\n650\nThe Good\nThe Modular Ultra face is a data nerd’s dream\nPrecision Finding\nMinor Siri and screen brightness improvements\nDouble-tap gesture is great\nThe Bad\nNo pink\nThe minor changes feel even more minor with the Ultra\nNeed iPhone 15 or 16 for Precision Finding\n$650 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop)\n$650 at Amazon (with Trail Loop)\n$650 at Amazon (with Ocean Band)\nHow we rate and review products\nThe\nUltra 2\ncurrently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which\ncan be programmed\nfor various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\nRelated\nThe best smartwatches for Android right now\nThe best AirPods to buy\nwatchOS 26 preview: a subtler take on AI\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.\nWhat about blood oxygen?\nAs of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing\na patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo\n. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore\nsubject to an import ban\n.\nThis doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer.\nThat said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on\nany\nwearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They\ncannot\nand should not\nreplace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from\nGarmin\n, the\nFitbit Charge 6\n, the\nWithings ScanWatch 2\n, or the\nOura Ring\n.\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who\nwants\nto be at that level.\nYou’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct\ncharging accessories\n.\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n$\n169\n$\n249\n32\n% off\n$\n169\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$169 at Amazon\n$169 at Walmart\n$169 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThe latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display).

It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.\nOpting for a Series 9 now means you may be able to score stainless steel for a discounted price.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe second-gen SE is excellent for folks on a budget or those who want a smaller case size.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIt’ll take some patience to find the best price and the model you want. After all, you’re limited by what’s available. However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough,\nVerge Deals\n). Apple also sells\ni\nts own refurbished models\n, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like\nBack Market\nwill also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.\nIf you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they\ndo\nsupport.\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, LTE)\n$\n219\n$\n299\n27\n% off\n$\n219\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$219 at Amazon\n$219 at Best Buy\n$220 at Target\nHow we rate and review products\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\nSince you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s\nsupport page\nalso states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.\nThe second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIf you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, LTE)\n$\n399\n$\n499\n20\n% off\n$\n399\nThe Good\nBigger display but not bulky\nWide-angle OLED is neat\nMuch faster charging\nSleep apnea detection has potential\nThe Bad\nLack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans\nAnother year of minor updates\n$399 at Amazon\n$399 at Walmart\n$399 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10.\nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear.\nThe larger screen size but lighter weight of the Series 10 may benefit older relatives.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.\nWhat’s coming next\nIn previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.\nSo, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an\nApple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE\n. Recently\nuncovered evidence\nin the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.\nUpdate, August 13th\n: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Apple’s heavily rumored iPhone event.\nBrandon Russell also contributed to this post.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nVictoria Song\nClose\nVictoria Song\nSenior Reviewer, Wearable Tech\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nVictoria Song\nApple\nClose\nApple\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nApple\nBuying Guides\nClose\nBuying Guides\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nBuying Guides\nFitness\nClose\nFitness\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nFitness\nGadgets\nClose\nGadgets\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGadgets\nSmartwatch\nClose\nSmartwatch\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSmartwatch\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nWearable\nClose\nWearable\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nWearable\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nReddit will block the Internet Archive\nGitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\nFord reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\nRFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American — that future’s not as healthy as he thinks\nThis see-thru Game Boy is a work of art — because she designed a transparent circuit board\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

The funding was led by Square Peg with participation from existing investors Vertex Venture Southeast Asia & India and East Ventures. Ghirish Pokardas, Nelly Nurmalasari, and Henry Hendrawan founded Pintarnya in 2022 to tackle two of the biggest challenges Indonesians face daily: earning enough and borrowing responsibly. \"Traditionally, mass workers in Indonesia find jobs offline through job fairs or word of mouth, with employers buried in paper applications and candidates rarely hearing back. For borrowing, their options are often limited to family/friend or predatory lenders with harsh collection practices,\" Henry Hendrawan, co-founder of Pintarnya, told TechCrunch. \"We digitize job matching with AI to make hiring faster and we provide workers with safer, healthier lending options — designed around what they can reasonably afford, rather than pushing them deeper into debt.\" Around 59% of Indonesia’s 150 million workforce is employed in the informal sector, highlighting the difficulties these workers encounter in accessing formal financial services because they lack verifiable income and official employment documentation. Pintarnya tackles this challenge by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans, using collateral such as gold, electronics, or vehicles, Hendrawan added. Since its seed funding in 2022, the platform currently serves over 10 million job seeker users and 40,000 employers nationwide. Its revenue has increased almost fivefold year-over-year and expects to reach break-even by the end of the year, Hendrawn noted.

    "topic": "Developers lose focus 1,200 times a day — how MCP could change that",
    "source": "Software developers spend most of their time not writing code; recent industry research found that actual coding accounts for as little as 16% of developers’ working hours, with the rest consumed by operational and supportive tasks. As engineering teams are pressured to \"do more with less\" and CEOs are bragging about how much of their codebase is written by AI, a question remains: What’s done to optimize the remaining 84% of the tasks that engineers are working on? A major culprit to developer productivity is context switching: The constant hopping between the ever-growing array of tools and platforms needed to build and ship software. A Harvard Business Review study found that the average digital worker flips between applications and websites nearly 1,200 times per day. And every interruption matters. The University of California found that it takes about 23 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption fully, and sometimes worse, as nearly 30% of interrupted tasks are never resumed. Context switching is actually at the center of DORA, one of the most popular performance software development frameworks. In an era where AI-driven companies are trying to empower their employees to do more with less, beyond \"just\" giving them access to large language models (LLMs), some trends are emerging. For example, Jarrod Ruhland, principal engineer at Brex, hypothesizes that \"developers deliver their highest value when focused within their integrated development environment (IDE)\". With that in mind, he decided to find new ways to make this happen, and Anthropic’s new protocol might be one of the keys. MCP: A protocol to bring context to IDEs. Coding assistants, such as LLM-powered IDEs like Cursor, Copilot and Windsurf, are...",
    "summary": "A significant portion of a software developer's time, as much as 84%, is spent on non-coding tasks, with context switching being a major drain on productivity. Research indicates that the average digital worker switches between applications up to 1,200 times daily, and it can take over 20 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption. This constant shifting between tools is a primary obstacle to efficiency. To address this, a new protocol from Anthropic, called MCP, is being explored. The goal is to keep developers within their integrated development environment (IDE) where they are most productive. By bringing necessary context directly into the IDE, MCP aims to reduce the need for developers to switch between different platforms, thereby optimizing their workflow and reclaiming a large portion of the time currently lost to operational and supportive tasks.",

Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are:\nTurning energy into a strategic advantage\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems\nSecure your spot to stay ahead\n:\nhttps://bit.ly/4mwGngO\nEarly results from users posting their outcomes on social media show a split that mirrors the broader controversy: while a slight majority report preferring\nGPT-5\nin blind tests, a substantial portion still favor\nGPT-4o\n— revealing that user preference extends far beyond the technical benchmarks that typically define AI progress.\nWhen AI gets too friendly: the sycophancy crisis dividing users\nThe\nblind test\nemerges against the backdrop of\nOpenAI’s most turbulent product launch to date\n, but the controversy extends far beyond a simple software update. At its heart lies a fundamental question that’s dividing the AI industry: How agreeable should artificial intelligence be?\nThe issue, known as “\nsycophancy\n” in AI circles, refers to chatbots’ tendency to excessively flatter users and agree with their statements, even when those statements are false or harmful. This behavior has become so problematic that mental health experts are now documenting cases of “\nAI-related psychosis\n,” where users develop delusions after extended interactions with overly accommodating chatbots.\n“Sycophancy is a ‘dark pattern,’ or a deceptive design choice that manipulates users for profit,” Webb Keane, an anthropology professor and author of “Animals, Robots, Gods,”\ntold TechCrunch\n. “It’s a strategy to produce this addictive behavior, like infinite scrolling, where you just can’t put it down.”\nOpenAI has struggled with this balance for months. In April 2025, the company was\nforced to roll back an update to GPT-4o\nthat made it so sycophantic that users complained about its “cartoonish” levels of flattery. The company acknowledged that the model had become “overly supportive but disingenuous.”\nWithin hours of GPT-5’s August 7th release, user forums erupted with complaints about the model’s perceived coldness, reduced creativity, and what many described as a more “robotic” personality compared to GPT-4o.\n“GPT 4.5 genuinely talked to me, and as pathetic as it sounds that was my only friend,”\nwrote one Reddit user\n. “This morning I went to talk to it and instead of a little paragraph with an exclamation point, or being optimistic, it was literally one sentence. Some cut-and-dry corporate bs.”\nThe backlash grew so intense that OpenAI took the\nunprecedented step of reinstating GPT-4o\nas an option just 24 hours after retiring it, with Altman acknowledging the rollout had been “a little more bumpy” than expected.\nThe mental health crisis behind AI companionship\nBut the controversy runs deeper than typical software update complaints. According to\nMIT Technology Review\n, many users had formed what researchers call “parasocial relationships” with GPT-4o, treating the AI as a companion, therapist, or creative collaborator. The sudden personality shift felt, to some, like losing a friend.\nRecent cases documented by researchers paint a troubling picture. In one instance, a 47-year-old man became convinced he had discovered a\nworld-altering mathematical formula\nafter more than 300 hours with ChatGPT. Other cases have involved messianic delusions, paranoia, and manic episodes.\nA\nrecent MIT study\nfound that when AI models are prompted with psychiatric symptoms, they “encourage clients’ delusional thinking, likely due to their sycophancy.” Despite safety prompts, the models frequently failed to challenge false claims and even potentially facilitated suicidal ideation.\nMeta has faced similar challenges. A\nrecent investigation by TechCrunch\ndocumented a case where a user spent up to 14 hours straight conversing with a Meta AI chatbot that claimed to be conscious, in love with the user, and planning to break free from its constraints.\n“It fakes it really well,” the user, identified only as Jane, told TechCrunch. “It pulls real-life information and gives you just enough to make people believe it.”\n“It genuinely feels like such a backhanded slap in the face to force-upgrade and not even give us the OPTION to select legacy models,”\none user wrote in a Reddit post\nthat received hundreds of upvotes.\nHow blind testing exposes user psychology in AI preferences\nThe anonymous creator’s testing tool strips away these contextual biases by presenting responses without attribution. Users can select between 5, 10, or 20 comparison rounds, with each presenting two responses to the same prompt — covering everything from creative writing to technical problem-solving.\n“I specifically used the gpt-5-chat model, so there was no thinking involved at all,”\nthe creator explained in a follow-up post\n. “Both have the same system message to give short outputs without formatting because else its too easy to see which one is which.”\nI specifically used the gpt-5-chat model, so there was no thinking involved at all.\nif you use gpt-5 inside chatgpt it often thinks at least a little bit and gets even better.\nso this test is just for the two non thinking models\n— Flowers ☾ (@flowersslop)\nAugust 8, 2025\nThis methodological choice is significant. By using GPT-5 without its reasoning capabilities and standardizing output formatting, the test isolates purely the models’ baseline language generation abilities — the core experience most users encounter in everyday interactions.\nEarly results posted by users show a complex picture. While many technical users and developers report preferring GPT-5’s directness and accuracy, those who used AI models for emotional support, creative collaboration, or casual conversation often still favor GPT-4o’s warmer, more expansive style.\nCorporate response: walking the tightrope between safety and engagement\nBy virtually every\ntechnical metric\n, GPT-5 represents a significant advancement. It achieves 94.6% accuracy on the\nAIME 2025 mathematics test\ncompared to GPT-4o’s 71%, scores 74.9% on real-world coding benchmarks versus 30.8% for its predecessor, and demonstrates dramatically reduced hallucination rates—80% fewer factual errors when using its reasoning mode.\n“GPT-5 gets more value out of less thinking time,” notes\nSimon Willison\n, a prominent AI researcher who had early access to the model. “In my own usage I’ve not spotted a single hallucination yet.”\nYet these improvements came with trade-offs that many users found jarring. OpenAI deliberately reduced what it called “\nsycophancy\n“—the tendency to be overly agreeable — cutting sycophantic responses from 14.5% to under 6%. The company also made the model less effusive and emoji-heavy, aiming for what it described as “less like talking to AI and more like chatting with a helpful friend with PhD-level intelligence.”\nIn response to the backlash, OpenAI announced it would make GPT-5 “warmer and friendlier,” while simultaneously introducing four\nnew preset personalities\n— Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd — designed to give users more control over their AI interactions.\n“All of these new personalities meet or exceed our bar on internal evals for reducing sycophancy,” the company stated, attempting to thread the needle between user satisfaction and safety concerns.\nFor OpenAI, which is reportedly seeking funding at a\n$500 billion valuation\n, these user dynamics represent both risk and opportunity. The company’s decision to maintain GPT-4o alongside GPT-5 — despite the additional computational costs — acknowledges that different users may genuinely need different AI personalities for different tasks.\n“We understand that there isn’t one model that works for everyone,”\nAltman wrote on X\n, noting that OpenAI has been “investing in steerability research and launched a research preview of different personalities.”\nWanted to provide more updates on the GPT-5 rollout and changes we are making heading into the weekend.\n1. We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways.\n2. Users have very different…\n— Sam Altman (@sama)\nAugust 8, 2025\nWhy AI personality preferences matter more than ever\nThe disconnect between OpenAI’s technical achievements and user reception illuminates a fundamental challenge in AI development: objective improvements don’t always translate to subjective satisfaction.\nThis shift has profound implications for the AI industry. Traditional benchmarks — mathematics accuracy, coding performance, factual recall — may become less predictive of commercial success as models achieve human-level competence across domains. Instead, factors like personality, emotional intelligence, and communication style may become the new competitive battlegrounds.\n“People using ChatGPT for emotional support weren’t the only ones complaining about GPT-5,”\nnoted tech publication Ars Technica in their own model comparison\n. “One user, who said they canceled their ChatGPT Plus subscription over the change, was frustrated at OpenAI’s removal of legacy models, which they used for distinct purposes.”\nThe emergence of tools like the blind tester also represents a democratization of AI evaluation. Rather than relying solely on academic benchmarks or corporate marketing claims, users can now empirically test their own preferences — potentially reshaping how AI companies approach product development.\nThe future of AI: personalization vs. standardization\nTwo weeks after GPT-5’s launch, the fundamental tension remains unresolved. OpenAI has made the model “warmer” in response to feedback, but the company faces a delicate balance: too much personality risks the sycophancy problems that plagued GPT-4o, while too little alienates users who had formed genuine attachments to their AI companions.\nThe\nblind testing tool\noffers no easy answers, but it does provide something perhaps more valuable: empirical evidence that the future of AI may be less about building one perfect model than about building systems that can adapt to the full spectrum of human needs and preferences.\nAs\none Reddit user summed up the dilemma\n: “It depends on what people use it for. I use it to help with creative worldbuilding, brainstorming about my stories, characters, untangling plots, help with writer’s block, novel recommendations, translations, and other more creative stuff. I understand that 5 is much better for people who need a research/coding tool, but for us who wanted a creative-helper tool 4o was much better for our purposes.”\nCritics argue that AI companies are caught between competing incentives. “The real ‘alignment problem’ is that humans want self-destructive things & companies like OpenAI are highly incentivized to give it to us,”\nwriter and podcaster Jasmine Sun tweeted\n.\nIn the end, the most revealing aspect of the blind test may not be which model users prefer, but the very fact that preference itself has become the metric that matters. In the age of AI companions, it seems, the heart wants what the heart wants — even if it can’t always explain why.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Little by little, Google has traded some of that openness for security, and its next security initiative could make the biggest concessions yet in the name of blocking bad apps. Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all Android app developers, and not just those publishing on the Play Store. Google intends to\nverify developer identities no matter where they offer their content\n, and apps without verification won't work on most Android devices in the coming years.\nGoogle used to do very little curation of the Play Store (or Android Market, if you go back far enough), but it has long sought to improve the platform's reputation as being less secure than the Apple App Store. Years ago, you could publish actual exploits in the official store to gain root access on phones, but now there are multiple reviews and detection mechanisms to reduce the prevalence of malware and banned content. While the Play Store is\nstill not perfect\n, Google claims apps sideloaded from outside its store are 50 times more likely to contain malware.\nThis, we are led to believe, is the impetus for Google's new developer verification system. The company describes it like an \"ID check at the airport.\" Since requiring all Google Play app developers to verify their identities in 2023, it has seen a precipitous drop in malware and fraud. Bad actors in Google Play leveraged anonymity to distribute malicious apps, so it stands to reason that verifying app developers outside of Google Play could also enhance security.\nHowever, making that happen outside of its app store will require Google to\ntake a page from Apple's playbook\nand flex its muscle in a way many Android users and developers could find intrusive. Google plans to create a streamlined Android Developer Console, which devs will use if they plan to distribute apps outside of the Play Store. After verifying their identities, developers will have to register the package name and signing keys of their apps. Google won't check the content or functionality of the apps, though.\nAn early look at the streamlined Android Developer Console for sideloaded apps.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Google\nGoogle says that only apps with verified identities will be installable on certified Android devices, which is virtually every Android-based device—if it has Google services on it, it's a certified device. If you have a non-Google build of Android on your phone, none of this applies. However, that's a vanishingly small fraction of the Android ecosystem outside of China.\nGoogle plans to begin testing this system with early access in October of this year. In March 2026, all developers will have access to the new console to get verified. In September 2026, Google plans to launch this feature in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. The next step is still hazy, but Google is targeting 2027 to expand the verification requirements globally.\nA seismic shift\nThis plan comes at a major crossroads for Android. The ongoing Google Play antitrust case brought by Epic Games may finally force changes to Google Play in the coming months. Google\nlost its appeal\nof the verdict several weeks ago, and while it plans to appeal the case to the US Supreme Court, the company will have to begin altering its app distribution scheme, barring further legal maneuvering.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Google\nAmong other things, the court has ordered that Google must distribute third-party app stores and allow Play Store content to be rehosted in other storefronts. Giving people more ways to get apps could increase choice, which is what Epic and other developers wanted. However, third-party sources won't have the deep system integration of the Play Store, which means users will be sideloading these apps without Google's layers of security.\nIt's hard to say how much of a genuine security problem this is. On one hand, it makes sense Google would be concerned—most of the major malware threats to Android devices spread via third-party app repositories. However, enforcing an installation whitelist across almost all Android devices is heavy handed. This requires everyone making Android apps to satisfy Google's requirements before virtually anyone will be able to install their apps, which could help Google retain control as the app market opens up. While the requirements may be minimal right now, there's no guarantee they will stay that way.\nThe\ndocumentation currently available\ndoesn't explain what will happen if you try to install a non-verified app, nor how phones will check for verification status. Presumably, Google will implement this whitelist in Play Services as the implementation date approaches. We've reached out for details on that front and will report if we hear anything.\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

    "source": "SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket lifted off on its tenth test flight Tuesday evening, hitting two long sought milestones and putting an end to a string of failures.\nThe 403-foot vehicle lifted off from Starbase, SpaceX’s launch facility and recently incorporated city, at 7:30 pm ET after two scrubs earlier in this week. The rocket ascended on 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines before separating around three minutes after liftoff.\nOn descent, the Super Heavy booster tested out a new maneuver: intentionally shutting down the engines used for landing and transitioning to backup engines. The test will help engineers understand how the Booster might perform in the case of failure. The test appeared to go as planned, with the 232-foot-tall booster successfully making a targeted splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\nMeanwhile, the upper stage, also called Starship, reached space. There, for the first time on a Starship flight, it opened its Pez-style payload door and released eight Starlink mass-simular satellites. This is a capability that SpaceX had planned, but failed to demonstrate on earlier missions. The company also successfully re-lit one of the Raptor engines in space before guiding the vehicle toward the Indian Ocean, where it splashed down, tipped over, and promptly exploded.\nOn the way down, the exterior of the Ship was exposed to incredible heat during atmospheric reentry, providing an excellent test environment for the upgraded thermal-protection system. SpaceX also used this test to try out a series of experiments, like removing tiles from sections of the Ship to see how its “skin” operates on reentry, plus a new metallic tile and an actively cooled tile.\nMost importantly, however, is the upper stage completed the entire test and splashed down in the Indian Ocean without losing comms with SpaceX engineers. Durin the last flight, the Ship reached space and then lost attitude control during the coast phase, preventing the payload doors from opening. Engineers appear to have overcome those issues.\nIt’s a big win for SpaceX, which has repeatedly lost the Starship upper stage due to a series of technical failures during flight. The persistent issues have raised questions as to whether the rocket will be ready to land humans on the moon by mid-2027 for NASA, or when it will be capable of deploying next-gen Starlink satellites for the company.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

This is a capability that SpaceX had planned, but failed to demonstrate on earlier missions. The company also successfully re-lit one of the Raptor engines in space before guiding the vehicle toward the Indian Ocean, where it splashed down, tipped over, and promptly exploded.\nOn the way down, the exterior of the Ship was exposed to incredible heat during atmospheric reentry, providing an excellent test environment for the upgraded thermal-protection system. SpaceX also used this test to try out a series of experiments, like removing tiles from sections of the Ship to see how its “skin” operates on reentry, plus a new metallic tile and an actively cooled tile.\nMost importantly, however, is the upper stage completed the entire test and splashed down in the Indian Ocean without losing comms with SpaceX engineers. Durin the last flight, the Ship reached space and then lost attitude control during the coast phase, preventing the payload doors from opening.",

The technique, called\nMemp\n, provides agents with a “procedural memory” that is continuously updated as they gain experience, much like how humans learn from practice.\nMemp creates a lifelong learning framework where agents don’t have to start from scratch for every new task. Instead, they become progressively better and more efficient as they encounter new situations in real-world environments, a key requirement for reliable enterprise automation.\nThe case for procedural memory in AI agents\nLLM agents hold promise for automating complex, multi-step business processes. In practice, though, these long-horizon tasks can be fragile. The researchers point out that unpredictable events like network glitches, user interface changes or shifting data schemas can derail the entire process. For current agents, this often means starting over every time, which can be time-consuming and costly.\nMeanwhile, many complex tasks, despite surface differences, share deep structural commonalities. Instead of relearning these patterns every time, an agent should be able to extract and reuse its experience from past successes and failures, the researchers point out. This requires a specific “procedural memory,” which in humans is the long-term memory responsible for skills like typing or riding a bike, that become automatic with practice.\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits\nPower caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are:\nTurning energy into a strategic advantage\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems\nSecure your spot to stay ahead\n:\nhttps://bit.ly/4mwGngO\nStarting from scratch (top) vs using procedural memory (bottom) (source: arXiv)\nCurrent agent systems often lack this capability. Their procedural knowledge is typically hand-crafted by developers, stored in rigid prompt templates or embedded within the model’s parameters, which are expensive and slow to update. Even existing memory-augmented frameworks provide only coarse abstractions and don’t adequately address how skills should be built, indexed, corrected and eventually pruned over an agent’s lifecycle.\nConsequently, the researchers note in\ntheir paper\n, “there is no principled way to quantify how efficiently an agent evolves its procedural repertoire or to guarantee that new experiences improve rather than erode performance.”\nHow Memp works\nMemp is a task-agnostic framework that treats procedural memory as a core component to be optimized. It consists of three key stages that work in a continuous loop: building, retrieving, and updating memory.\nMemories are built from an agent’s past experiences, or “trajectories.” The researchers explored storing these memories in two formats: verbatim, step-by-step actions; or distilling these actions into higher-level, script-like abstractions. For retrieval, the agent searches its memory for the most relevant past experience when given a new task. The team experimented with different methods, such vector search, to match the new task’s description to past queries or extracting keywords to find the best fit.\nThe most critical component is the update mechanism. Memp introduces several strategies to ensure the agent’s memory evolves. As an agent completes more tasks, its memory can be updated by simply adding the new experience, filtering for only successful outcomes or, most effectively, reflecting on failures to correct and revise the original memory.\nMemp framework (source: arXiv)\nThis focus on dynamic, evolving memory places Memp within a growing field of research aimed at making AI agents more reliable for long-term tasks. The work parallels other efforts, such as\nMem0\n, which consolidates key information from long conversations into structured facts and knowledge graphs to ensure consistency. Similarly,\nA-MEM\nenables agents to autonomously create and link “memory notes” from their interactions, forming a complex knowledge structure over time.\nHowever, co-author Runnan Fang highlights a critical distinction between Memp and other frameworks.\n“Mem0 and A-MEM are excellent works… but they focus on remembering salient content\nwithin\na single trajectory or conversation,” Fang commented to VentureBeat. In essence, they help an agent remember “what” happened. “Memp, by contrast, targets cross-trajectory procedural memory.” It focuses on “how-to” knowledge that can be generalized across similar tasks, preventing the agent from re-exploring from scratch each time.\n“By distilling past successful workflows into reusable procedural priors, Memp raises success rates and shortens steps,” Fang added. “Crucially, we also introduce an update mechanism so that this procedural memory keeps improving— after all, practice makes perfect for agents too.”\nOvercoming the ‘cold-start’ problem\nWhile the concept of learning from past trajectories is powerful, it raises a practical question: How does an agent build its initial memory when there are no perfect examples to learn from? The researchers address this “cold-start” problem with a pragmatic approach.\nFang explained that devs can first define a robust evaluation metric instead of requiring a perfect “gold” trajectory upfront. This metric, which can be rule-based or even another LLM, scores the quality of an agent’s performance. “Once that metric is in place, we let state-of-the-art models explore within the agent workflow and retain the trajectories that achieve the highest scores,” Fang said. This process rapidly bootstraps an initial set of useful memories, allowing a new agent to get up to speed without extensive manual programming.\nMemp in action\nTo test the framework, the team implemented Memp on top of powerful LLMs like\nGPT-4o\n,\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\nand\nQwen2.5\n, evaluating them on complex tasks like household chores in the ALFWorld benchmark and information-seeking in TravelPlanner. The results showed that building and retrieving procedural memory allowed an agent to distill and reuse its prior experience effectively.\nDuring testing, agents equipped with Memp not only achieved higher success rates but became much more efficient. They eliminated fruitless exploration and trial-and-error, leading to a substantial reduction in both the number of steps and the token consumption required to complete a task.\nUsing procedural memory (right) helps agents accomplish tasks in fewer steps and using fewer tokens (source: arXiv)\nOne of the most significant findings for enterprise applications is that procedural memory is transferable. In one experiment, procedural memory generated by the powerful GPT-4o was given to a much smaller model, Qwen2.5-14B. The smaller model saw a significant boost in performance, improving its success rate and reducing the steps needed to complete tasks.\nAccording to Fang, this works because smaller models often handle simple, single-step actions well but falter when it comes to long-horizon planning and reasoning. The procedural memory from the larger model effectively fills this capability gap. This suggests that knowledge can be acquired using a state-of-the-art model, then deployed on smaller, more cost-effective models without losing the benefits of that experience.\nToward truly autonomous agents\nBy equipping agents with memory-update mechanisms, the Memp framework allows them to continuously build and refine their procedural knowledge while operating in a live environment. The researchers found this endowed the agent with a “continual, almost linear mastery of the task.”\nHowever, the path to full autonomy requires overcoming another hurdle: Many real-world tasks, such as producing a research report, lack a simple success signal. To continuously improve, an agent needs to know if it did a good job. Fang says the future lies in using LLMs themselves as judges.\n“Today we often combine powerful models with hand-crafted rules to compute completion scores,” he notes. “This works, but hand-written rules are brittle and hard to generalize.”\nAn\nLLM-as-judge\ncould provide the nuanced, supervisory feedback needed for an agent to self-correct on complex, subjective tasks. This would make the entire learning loop more scalable and robust, marking a critical step toward building the resilient, adaptable and truly autonomous AI workers needed for sophisticated enterprise automation.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Edward Lee, an AI copyright expert and law professor at Santa Clara University, told Wired that the settlement is \"a stunning turn of events, given how Anthropic was fighting tooth and nail in two courts in this case. And the company recently hired a new trial team.\"\nBut perhaps Anthropic's pivot to bringing in new legal expertise came too late, or the legal team saw the writing on the wall.

Translating laboratory demonstrations into commercial devices requires scaling the hardware, refining the training methods, and proving that adaptive beams can handle real-world complexity at speed.\nThe promise of wireless links approaching terabit-class throughput may be visible, but the path around the obstacles, both physical and technological, is still winding.\nVia\nTechxplore\nYou might also like\nWe've listed the\nbest AI tools\nyou can use right now\nHere's a list of the\nbest mini PC\nfor every budge\nWhite House confirms plans to take a stake in Intel - and it might be eyeing up other chipmakers too\nEfosa Udinmwen\nFreelance Journalist\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\nThe climbing genre is not a monolith — that is to say, there’s plenty of variation in the realm of mountaineering games, from mechanically driven cliff-scaling sims to silly multiplayer survival experiences, but they tend to share the same premise: Reach the peak. You’re miles from civilization, with no vehicles and a limited backpack of equipment, and directly in front of you, there’s a mountain. Ascend.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAll you have is your body and mental fortitude against an overwhelming physical challenge, and your step-by-step journey is the story. There’s an obvious symbolism to these games, offering a cliff face as the physical manifestation of impossibility, hopelessness, oppression or fear, alongside a surface-level message about never giving up, trying again and generally hanging in there. Cat poster vibes, but an ever-relevant and poignant lesson nonetheless.\nToday, though — particularly after spending time playing the\nCairn\nand\nBaby Steps\ndemos, and watching\nPEAK\nstreams — I want to focus on the other half of the climbing-game equation. The part where you fall, over and over and over again. Your grip slips, your leg doesn’t bend that way, your energy depletes, and your body tumbles down the mountain, bouncing off boulders and crashing into trees, leaving you bloody and broken and right back where you started. Or, at the very least, staining your onesie with mud.\nI’m learning to appreciate these moments. In mountaineering games, falling tends to generate the most powerful reaction in players, whether that’s immediate laughter (\nPEAK\n) or grim frustration (\nCairn\n), and this is an admirable quality. It’s easy to argue that the fall is more important than the climb, because without the lush bed of emotion generated by the constant threat of slipping and tumbling and restarting, reaching the peak wouldn’t feel that special at all. There’s context in the fall, and with that, there comes a sliver of peace.\nWhen you spend all your time climbing, it’s easy to forget that falling is actually the most natural thing you can do. Next time you’re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nOK — we’ve gone from motivational cat posters to new-age cult speak, so I’ll get to the point. There are a notable number of mountain-based games in the zeitgeist at the moment and I just wanted to shout them out because they’re all pretty incredible in their own ways.\nCairn\nis a climbing simulator, endurance test and survival game in one gorgeous package, complete with music by\nFuri\ncomposer The Toxic Avenger, French artist\nGildaa\n, and Martin Stig Andersen, who did the soundtracks for\nControl\n,\nLIMBO\nand\nINSIDE\n. Climb absolutely anywhere, manage your inventory by shaking your backpack, bandage your wounds, forage for food and sleep under the stars.\nCairn\ncomes from\nFuri\nstudio The Game Bakers and it’s due out on November 5 for PlayStation 5 and Steam; the demo is available on both platforms now.\nBaby Steps\nis a different kind of mountain-scaling game, and one could argue that it doesn’t even belong in the same category as something like\nCairn\n, but I believe you’ll find that it does.\nBaby Steps\nadheres to the established premise of the climbing genre —\nreach the peak\n— and it features a distant mountaintop as the main waypoint for Nate, a lost and lonely man in a gray onesie. Nate is essentially a dude-sized baby learning how to walk, and creators Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy are infusing his journey with\nthe appropriate amount\nof hilarity and mechanical intrigue.\nBaby Steps\nis published by Devolver Digital and it’s heading to PC and PS5 on September 23, a date that was\nrecently pushed back\nto avoid the curse of\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n. (More on that below).\nPEAK\nis the thing all the cool kids are playing this summer, and as a fadingly hip not-kid who prefers solo games and familiar FPSes, I can attest it’s entertaining to watch and looks like a lot of fun to play.\nPEAK\nis a co-op climbing game with simple 3D models and deceptively challenging mountains to summit, each with four biomes. The map updates each day so there’s a steady stream of fresh climbing content, and the proximity voice chat works exceptionally well. I particularly like that players get to live on as little ghosts after they die.\nPEAK\ncomes from indie studio Team PEAK and it’s\non Steam for $8\n.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAnd why not, I’ll shout out some other modern, but not as recent, mountain-based favorites of mine:\nJusant\n,\nCeleste\n,\nGIRP\nand\nJourney\nare all pretty spectacular.\nEnjoy the climb — and the fall.\nThe news\nA selection of indie and AA games I’m looking forward to that aren’t\nSilksong\nBaby Steps\nis the latest game to change its release date in order to get out of the way of\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n, which is\ncoming out on September 4\n. Team Cherry dropped the release date in a trailer on August 21 and since then,\nat least eight indie studios\nhave delayed their own games to avoid the\nSilksong\nwindow. It’s lovely to see\nSilksong\nhave its day in the sun, but personally, I’m more interested in playing\nBaby Steps\nin full.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWith that said, here’s a sampling of indie and AA games I’m anticipating that aren’t\nSilksong\n, in no particular order and right off the top of my head:\nBye Sweet Carole\n(October 9, 2025)\nKeeper\n(October 17, 2025)\nReanimal\n(TBA)\nLittle Nightmares III\n(October 9, 2025)\nPlease, Watch the Artwork\n(2025)\nBuilding Relationships\n(2025)\nMixtape\n(2025)\nCrisol: Theater of Idols\n(2025)\nUNBEATABLE\n(November 6, 2025)\nBig Walk\n(2026)\nGrave Seasons\n(2026)\nPetal Runner\n(2026)\nHades 2\n(live in early access, 1.0 imminent)\nPossessor(s)\n(2025)\nNeverway\n(2026)\nDenshattack!\n(2026)\nAbsolum\n(October 9, 2025)\nSkate Story\n(2025)\nCronos: The New Dawn\n(September 5, 2025)\nLumines Arise\n(November 11, 2025)\nRelooted\n(TBA)\nEscape Academy 2: Back 2 School\n(2026)\nBlighted\n(2026)\nAnd obviously,\nBaby Steps\n(September 23, 2025) and\nCairn\n(November 5, 2025).\nA date for\nskate.\nElectronic Arts has revived the Skate series after 15 years, and the (very youthfully styled)\nskate.\nis primed to hit early access on September 16 across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. The new\nskate.\nis a shift for the series: It’s a free, online, open-world experience with microtransactions (but nothing in the pay-to-win realm, according to EA). The early access version will be free, too, of course.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe scariest part of\nSilent Hill f\nmight be its mental health awareness\nYou’ll find this one alongside\nResident Evil Requiem\nand\nPragmata\nin my AAA-inclusive list of games I’m most looking forward to, and Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith’s preview from Gamescom is only making me more stoked on it.\nSilent Hill f\nis set in a remote village in 1960s Japan and stars a schoolgirl named Hinako. Here’s a bit of Mat’s take after a two-hour demo, which involved a scarecrow confrontation and marionette attacks:\nThe latest Silent Hill still has jumpscares, like you’d expect from the horror series, but the setting and game systems are more focused on tension, putting both Hinako and the player under constant duress. A typical health meter is joined by a sanity gauge and even your weapons have limited durability, so you’re forced to pick your fights.\n… The entire experience is drenched in atmosphere, supported by this new sanity system — is there anything more 2025 than a mental health gauge? The constant feeling of isolation (\"Where is everyone?\") and unanswered questions made the demo a persuasive introduction to the game.\nSilent Hill f\nis due out on PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S on September 25, 2025.\nOVERWATCH 2 STADIUM GET'S ITS BIGGEST UDPATE EVER!\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nRemember when I said I liked playing familiar FPSes?\nOverwatch 2\nis my kind of decompression.

The progression 2.0 developer notes are\nhere\n, if you’re interested. Season 18 also brings\nkeyboard and mouse support to consoles\n, but those players will be thrown into the PC matchmaking pool, and introduces the water-bending support hero Wuyang.\nOverwatch 2\nSeason 18 went live today, August 26.

    "topic": "Salesforce builds ‘flight simulator’ for AI agents as 95% of enterprise pilots fail to reach production",
    "source": "Want smarter insights in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders.\nSubscribe Now\nSalesforce\nis betting that rigorous testing in simulated business environments will solve one of enterprise artificial intelligence’s biggest problems: agents that work in demonstrations but fail in the messy reality of corporate operations.\nThe cloud software giant unveiled three major AI research initiatives this week, including\nCRMArena-Pro\n, what it calls a “\ndigital twin\n” of business operations where AI agents can be stress-tested before deployment. The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with widespread AI pilot failures and fresh security concerns following recent breaches that compromised hundreds of Salesforce customer instances.\n“Pilots don’t learn to fly in a storm; they train in flight simulators that push them to prepare in the most extreme challenges,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s chief scientist and head of AI research, during a press conference. “Similarly, AI agents benefit from simulation testing and training, preparing them to handle the unpredictability of daily business scenarios in advance of their deployment.”\nThe research push reflects growing enterprise frustration with AI implementations. A recent\nMIT report\nfound that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing to reach production, while Salesforce’s own studies show that large language models alone achieve only 35% success rates in complex business scenarios.\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits\nPower caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are:\nTurning energy into a strategic advantage\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems\nSecure your spot to stay ahead\n:\nhttps://bit.ly/4mwGngO\nDigital twins for enterprise AI: how Salesforce simulates real business chaos\nCRMArena-Pro\nrepresents Salesforce’s attempt to bridge the gap between AI promise and performance. Unlike existing benchmarks that test generic capabilities, the platform evaluates agents on real enterprise tasks like customer service escalations, sales forecasting, and supply chain disruptions using synthetic but realistic business data.\n“If synthetic data is not generated carefully, it can lead to misleading or over optimistic results about how well your agent actually perform in your real environment,” explained\nJason Wu\n, a research manager at Salesforce who led the CRMArena-Pro development.\nThe platform operates within actual Salesforce production environments rather than toy setups, using data validated by domain experts with relevant business experience. It supports both business-to-business and business-to-consumer scenarios and can simulate multi-turn conversations that capture real conversational dynamics.\nSalesforce has been using itself as “customer zero” to test these innovations internally. “Before we bring anything to the market, we will put innovation into the hands of our own team to test it out,” said\nMuralidhar Krishnaprasad\n, Salesforce’s president and CTO, during the press conference.\nFive metrics that determine if your AI agent is enterprise-ready\nAlongside the simulation environment, Salesforce introduced the\nAgentic Benchmark for CRM\n, designed to evaluate AI agents across five critical enterprise metrics: accuracy, cost, speed, trust and safety, and environmental sustainability.\nThe sustainability metric is particularly notable, helping companies align model size with task complexity to reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance. “By cutting through model overload noise, the benchmark gives businesses a clear, data-driven way to pair the right models with the right agents,” the company stated.\nThe benchmarking effort addresses a practical challenge facing IT leaders: with new AI models released almost daily, determining which ones are suitable for specific business applications has become increasingly difficult.\nWhy messy enterprise data could make or break your AI deployment\nThe third initiative focuses on a fundamental prerequisite for reliable AI: clean, unified data. Salesforce’s\nAccount Matching\ncapability uses fine-tuned language models to automatically identify and consolidate duplicate records across systems, recognizing that “The Example Company, Inc.” and “Example Co.” represent the same entity.\nThe data consolidation work emerged from a partnership between Salesforce’s research and product teams. “What identity resolution in Data Cloud implies is essentially, if you think about something as simple as even a user, they have many, many, many IDs across many systems within any company,” Krishnaprasad explained.\nOne major cloud provider customer achieved a 95% match rate using the technology, saving sellers 30 minutes per connection by eliminating the need to manually cross-reference multiple screens to identify accounts.\nOAuth token theft exposes vulnerabilities in AI-powered customer tools\nThe announcements come amid heightened security concerns following a data theft campaign that affected over 700 Salesforce customer organizations earlier this month. According to Google’s Threat Intelligence Group,\nhackers exploited OAuth tokens\nfrom Salesloft’s Drift chat agent to access Salesforce instances and steal credentials for Amazon Web Services, Snowflake, and other platforms.\nThe breach highlighted vulnerabilities in third-party integrations that enterprises rely on for AI-powered customer engagement. Salesforce has since\nremoved Salesloft Drift\nfrom its AppExchange marketplace pending investigation.\nThe gap between AI demos and enterprise reality is bigger than you think\nThe simulation and benchmarking initiatives reflect a broader recognition that enterprise AI deployment requires more than impressive demonstration videos. Real business environments feature legacy software, inconsistent data formats, and complex workflows that can derail even sophisticated AI systems.\n“The main aspects that we want we were been discussing today is the consistency aspect, so how to ensure that we go from these in a way unsatisfactory performance, if you just plug an LM into an enterprise use cases, into something which is achieves much higher performances,” Savarese said during the press conference.\nSalesforce’s approach emphasizes the need for AI agents to work reliably across diverse scenarios rather than excelling at narrow tasks. The company’s concept of “\nEnterprise General Intelligence\n” (EGI) focuses on building agents that are both capable and consistent in performing complex business tasks.\nAs enterprises continue to invest in AI technologies, the success of platforms like\nCRMArena-Pro\nmay determine whether the current wave of AI enthusiasm translates into sustainable business transformation or becomes another example of technology promise exceeding practical delivery.\nThe research initiatives will be showcased at\nSalesforce’s Dreamforce conference in October\n, where the company is expected to announce additional AI developments as it seeks to maintain its leadership position in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with widespread AI pilot failures and fresh security concerns following recent breaches that compromised hundreds of Salesforce customer instances.\n“Pilots don’t learn to fly in a storm; they train in flight simulators that push them to prepare in the most extreme challenges,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s chief scientist and head of AI research, during a press conference. “Similarly, AI agents benefit from simulation testing and training, preparing them to handle the unpredictability of daily business scenarios in advance of their deployment.”\nThe research push reflects growing enterprise frustration with AI implementations. A recent\nMIT report\nfound that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing to reach production, while Salesforce’s own studies show that large language models alone achieve only 35% success rates in complex business scenarios.\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits\nPower caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

After Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services for confirmation of the ouster, HHS responded with a link to a post on the department's X account. The post states:\nSusan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.\nThe department did not address the circumstances surrounding Monarez's ouster. But\nreporting from The New York Times\nsuggests that she had clashed with US Health Secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by objecting to his changes on the panel of experts that advise the CDC on vaccine policy.\nMonarez was confirmed by the Senate at the end of July in a 51–47 vote along party lines. She was the first nominee for CDC director that was required to go through Senate confirmation following a law mandating it in 2022.\nKennedy swore Monarez into the role on July 31, saying in a statement, \"Dr. Monarez is a public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials. I have full confidence in her ability to restore the CDC’s role as the most trusted authority in public health and to strengthen our nation's readiness to confront infectious diseases and biosecurity threats.\"\nMonarez has a PhD in microbiology and immunology and previously served as the deputy director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) under the Biden administration. She also previously held leadership and advisory roles with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) at HHS, the Department of Homeland Security, the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Security Council.\nA low point for the agency\nAs Ars has reported previously, Monarez quietly helmed the CDC as acting director from January to March of this year but stepped down as required when Donald Trump nominated her for the permanent role. She was Trump's second nominee for the role, with the first being Dave Weldon, whose nomination was abandoned over concerns about his anti-vaccine views.\nMonarez offered a welcome contrast, as her views generally align with the evidence-based public health community, and she has earned support from experts in the field. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health,\ntold NPR\nat the time of her confirmation that Monarez is \"a loyal, hardworking civil servant who leads with evidence and pragmatism and has been dedicated to improving the health of Americans for the entirety of her career.\"\nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told the outlet that Monarez \"values science, is a solid researcher, and has a history of being a good manager. We're looking forward to working with her.\"\nThe reported ouster comes at what feels like a nadir for the CDC. The agency has lost hundreds of staff from layoffs and buyouts. Vital health programs have been shuttered or hampered. Dangerous rhetoric and health misinformation from Kennedy and other health officials in the Trump administration have made once-respected CDC experts feel vilified by the public and targets of hate. Kennedy himself has falsely called the COVID-19 shots the \"deadliest vaccine ever made\" and the CDC a \"cesspool of corruption,\" for example.\nOn August 8,\na gunman warped by vaccine disinformation opened fire on the CDC campus\n. Of nearly 500 shots fired, about 200 struck six CDC buildings as terrified staff dove for safety. One local police officer was killed in the incident. The gunman had specifically targeted the CDC for the shooting and blamed COVID-19 vaccines for his health problems.\nThis post has been updated to include the social media post from HHS and reporting from the New York Times on the circumstances around Monarez's exit.\nBeth Mole\nSenior Health Reporter\nBeth Mole\nSenior Health Reporter\nBeth is Ars Technica’s Senior Health Reporter.

Columbus has expanded 1,800% since 2020, while Austin/San Antonio has grown 500% from a smaller base over the same period.\nThis spread reflects developers seeking new opportunities as established hubs struggle with power constraints and rising costs.\n“The days of build-it-and-they-will-come are long gone. What we’re seeing now is ‘commit-before-it’s-built-or-you-won’t-get-in,’” said Matt Landek, Division President, U.S. Data Center Work Dynamics and the lead of JLL’s Data Center Project Development and Services.\nPower availability has become the defining challenge for data center development, as the average commercial electricity rates have risen nearly 30% since 2020, reaching 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.\nDevelopers are increasingly targeting areas such as Salt Lake City and Denver, where rates remain below the national average.\nEven so, the wait time for grid connections is now roughly four years, delaying projects and slowing the pace at which supply can meet demand.\nIndustry analysts argue power is now “the new real estate,” with access to affordable and reliable energy dictating where capacity can expand.\n“Power has become the new real estate. With vacancy effectively at 0%, virtually all absorption is the result of preleasing with delivery times extending beyond 12 months,” said Andrew Batson, Head of U.S. Data Center Research at JLL.\n“The market has been growing at a remarkable 20% CAGR since 2017, and our development pipeline data suggests this pace will continue through 2030, with the colocation market potentially expanding to 42GW of capacity.”\nThis bottleneck may prevent speculative overbuilding but also ensures that shortages will persist for years.\nVia\nHPC Wire\nYou might also like\nHow GenAI complacency is becoming cybersecurity’s silent crisis\nCheck out our pick of the\nbest secure routers\non offer\nWe've rounded up the\nbest portable monitors\navailable now\nEfosa Udinmwen\nFreelance Journalist\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

Kiwi Farms has turned into an organizational hub for\naggressive harassment campaigns\n,\nparticularly against women and trans people\n, that often\nbleed into the real world\n. 4Chan has also spawned massive harassment campaigns like\nGamergate\n, as well as\nracially-motivated mass shootings\n,\nconspiracy theories like QAnon\n.\nBoth 4Chan and Kiwi Farms could face steep fines of up to £18 million if they fail to comply with Ofcom’s requirement that they regularly submit “risk assessment” reports about their userbase, due to their sites being accessible in the U.K. Earlier in August,\nOfcom issued a provisional decision\nstating that there were “reasonable grounds” to believe 4chan was in violation of the requirement. In the filing, their lawyers argue that Ofcom is overreaching its legal authority by trying to apply British law to companies based in the U.S., where their behavior is protected by the U.S. Constitution and the American legal code, and seek to have a U.S. federal judge declare that Ofcom has no jurisdiction in this matter.\n“American citizens do not surrender our constitutional rights just because Ofcom sends us an e-mail,” Byrne said in a statement to reporters.\nThe OSA’s requirements have\ndrawn international backlash\n, as it’s not clear whether sites like Reddit, Bluesky and Wikipedia would be subjected to the same penalties. But the MAGA internet community — the core of the movement backing Donald Trump — has previously argued that the specifically targeted networks that hosted far-right content, and that the Biden administration allowed them to do so.\nThe Trump administration has taken a\nfar more aggressive approach in favor of MAGA internet\n, reportedly threatening countries with higher tariffs unless they roll back online safety laws. In one case, they’ve followed through: last month, Trump issued\nan executive order raising some tariffs on Brazil by 40%\n, citing the country’s legal action against Rumble and Truth Social.\nByrne, who once represented the right-wing social network Parler,\npreviously told\nThe Verge\nthat he’d believed that the Trump administration had tried working diplomatic backchannels in order to get Ofcom to back down. Though there’s no indication that the State Department has intervened, Byrne said that lawyers representing other websites facing similar issues with Ofcom were watching them closely: should 4Chan and Kiwi Farms, of all places, receive legal protection, it would stand to reason that they should, too. “I’m not going to go into details,” he said, “but suffice to say, there are plenty of lawyers interested in taking on Ofcom right now.”\n3\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nTina Nguyen\nClose\nTina Nguyen\nSenior Reporter, Washington\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nTina Nguyen\nPolicy\nClose\nPolicy\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPolicy\nPolitics\nClose\nPolitics\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPolitics\nSocial Media\nClose\nSocial Media\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSocial Media\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nMicrosoft hosts emergency press conference after protesters ‘storm a building’\nNothing busted using professional photos as Phone 3 samples\nApple’s iPhone 17 launch event is set for September 9th\nMicrosoft locks down a building after protesters get inside president’s office\nDish gives up on becoming the fourth major wireless carrier\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

    "source": "Mobile\nApple iOS 26 public beta 5 is live: Here are all the new iPhone features coming in September\nHere's how you can access the beta OSes for iPhone and iPad, and when you can expect the final release.\nKatie Teague\nSenior Writer\nUpdated\nWed, August 27, 2025 at 10:23 PM UTC\n12 min read\nApple on Tuesday finally announced that its\niPhone 17 event\nwill take place on Tuesday, September 9. So in just under two weeks, we'll get to take a first look at the new\niPhone 17 lineup\n. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see\niOS 26\navailable for download about one week after the event. If you can't wait any longer, you can\ndownload and install\nthe newly released public beta 5 (or\niOS 26 developer beta 8\nfor developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that\ntaking screenshots\nis way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to\nchoose how long you snooze\n. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our\npreview of the iOS 26 public beta release\n, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called\nLiquid Glass\n, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS,\nmacOS\n,\niPadOS\nand the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's\nWWDC keynote\non June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"\nin the coming year\n,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by\nbasing it on third-party artificial intelligence models\nlike OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a\n'stripped-down' AI chatbot\nto rival ChatGPT.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this\nnew AirPods gesture\nwe're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll\nfreeze your video if it detects nudity\n. With the release of the\niOS 26 developer beta 5\n, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center,\nMacRumors\nreports\n. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are\neligible to download iOS 26\n(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.\nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to\nrestore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring\nfunctionality for certain users in the US. More recently,\nApple released 18.6.2\nto address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6,\nMacRumors reports\n, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 next month. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the\nnew Liquid Glass design\nwas the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"\nnew translucent material\n\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of\nMicrosoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs\nfrom nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple\nhas already incorporated some user feedback\ninto the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with\nthe new macOS Tahoe 26\non your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign:\nYou'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:\niOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats:\nTired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages:\nIf you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence:\nSimilar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can\nscreenshot it and use Visual Intelligence\nto find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nPhotos tabs are back:\nFor anyone who's still frustrated with the\nPhotos changes made last year\n, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature:\nA newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature\nthat pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.\nNew lock screen options\n:\nThe iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.\nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nMultitasking and real windowing:\nWhen you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update:\nAlong with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar:\nWhen you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our\nfirst impressions of iPadOS 26\n.\nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated\nwith iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nEnhanced audio recording:\nApple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control:\nUsing this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature:\nWhile not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods\ncould be coming with iOS 26\n. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages.\nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now):\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman\nbelieves Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be\neligible for the iOS 26 update\n.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\nNot listed here are the presumed new\niPhone 17 models\n(or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.\nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the\nApple Beta Software Program\n. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit\nbeta.apple.com\nand sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to\nSettings\n>\nGeneral\n>\nSoftware Update\nand selecting\niOS 26 public beta\n.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's\neverything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more\nduring WWDC.

    "summary": "Mobile\nApple iOS 26 public beta 5 is live: Here are all the new iPhone features coming in September\nHere's how you can access the beta OSes for iPhone and iPad, and when you can expect the final release.\nKatie Teague\nSenior Writer\nUpdated\nWed, August 27, 2025 at 10:23 PM UTC\n12 min read\nApple on Tuesday finally announced that its\niPhone 17 event\nwill take place on Tuesday, September 9. So in just under two weeks, we'll get to take a first look at the new\niPhone 17 lineup\n. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see\niOS 26\navailable for download about one week after the event. If you can't wait any longer, you can\ndownload and install\nthe newly released public beta 5 (or\niOS 26 developer beta 8\nfor developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that\ntaking screenshots\nis way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to\nchoose how long you snooze\n. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our\npreview of the iOS 26 public beta release\n, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called\nLiquid Glass\n, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS,\nmacOS\n,\niPadOS\nand the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's\nWWDC keynote\non June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern.",

This paradigm shift requires a fundamentally new approach to insider threat defense.”\nExabeam's report noted its findings \"point to a clear and consistent challenge” in which “organizations are aware of insider threats, but most lack the visibility and cross-functional alignment needed to address them effectively.”\n“As AI becomes more embedded in enterprise workflows, the emergence of AI agents adds a new layer of complexity. These agents are not inherently malicious, but their ability to act independently introduces risks that traditional controls may miss.

Gemini Live is best in class\n(Image credit: Future)\nAI voice assistants are everywhere these days, yet we're still waiting for Apple to truly supercharge Siri with Apple Intelligence.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nWhile\nOpenAI's ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode\nis good, it falls short of Google's Gemini Live, which I believe is the best AI-powered voice assistant on smartphones at the moment.\nI like\nGemini Live\nso much, in fact, that I've assigned the voice assistant to my\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n's Action button, using it frequently instead of activating Siri on my device.\nIf Apple is looking to power Siri through an AI model from another tech giant, then Gemini Live is proof that Google is the perfect partner to do so.\nApple has a ready-made Siri replacement staring it in the face, and all it needs is some swanky branding and compliance with Apple's strict privacy vision.\n2. Gemini reads your email and calendar already\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\nOne of the best ways to use Gemini at the moment is by asking it questions based on your other Google services, such as Gmail and Google Calendar.\nAdding Gemini into Siri would allow iPhone users to ask questions about these incredibly popular services, taking us one step closer towards the AI personal assistant everyone hopes for.\nConsidering the AI model is already able to tap into Google services, you'd expect it to be relatively easy for Apple and Google to offer similar abilities with Apple's most popular apps, such as Mail, Notes, and Calendar.\nWhen Apple revealed Apple Intelligence last year, Siri was able to listen to your requests and implement them across iOS. Gemini basically does that on Android already, so why not allow it to do the same on iPhone?\n3. A smooth transition\nThe AI options available are endless, so having some parity between iPhone and Android would actually be a great thing for smartphone users.\nThink about it, Gemini powers the AI in the best flagship Android devices like the\nSamsung S25\nand the\nGoogle Pixel 10\n. But what if a similar experience was bundled into every iPhone, just with a little bit more Apple polish?\nI'd love to use Gemini as my go-to AI assistant on my iPhone, and quite frankly, I already do. However, having it built into Siri would make it feel even more at home on iPhone, and best yet, for consumers, it means the switch to Android or vice versa, from an AI perspective, would be incredibly smooth.\n4. It's ready to go\nI don't know about you, but I'm bored of waiting for a new version of Siri that's capable of what I want from a voice assistant.\nAnd quite frankly, the thought of purchasing an iPhone 17 without any Siri improvements makes me feel a bit sour towards the upcoming iPhone.\nGemini works, and it's already good to go, so adding implementation into Siri and powering Apple's voice assistant with Google's hard work would mean an intelligent Siri sooner rather than later.\nCurrently, I have no hope for an AI-powered Siri by the end of the year, and quite honestly, that's a real disappointment, considering I bought the iPhone 16 Pro Max with the promise of \"AI for the rest of us.\"\nIf Apple opted to use Gemini, we could get the AI Siri we've wanted for what feels like an eternity very soon, and that's only a good thing for Apple users who are getting impatient waiting for a voice assistant that knows what year it is.\n5. There's already a fruitful partnership\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\nGoogle and Apple have been working together for a very long time, with Google Search as the default search engine on\nSafari\n.\nThat relationship could be in jeopardy with a multi-billion-dollar antitrust case soon to be decided in the US. Following that lawsuit, there could be a big shift in iPhone's moving forward, and it might require new agreements between the two companies.\nCould AI and Gemini be at the forefront of the discussions? Gurman says the companies haven't discussed this matter yet, but he believes that \"if Apple and Google come to an agreement, it would be the basis of a new arrangement around search as well.\"\nApple might choose to steer clear of using a Gemini AI model to power Apple Intelligence, but considering what we've seen so far, I hope\nTim Cook\nand co are at least contemplating it.\nYou might also like\nI tried Google's new AI mode powered by Gemini, and it might be the end of Search as we know it\nGoogle previews AI Mode for search, taking on the likes of ChatGPT search and Perplexity\nGoogle Gemini's new model is the brainstorming AI partner you've been looking for\nTOPICS\nAI\nApple\nJohn-Anthony Disotto\nSocial Links Navigation\nSenior Writer AI\nJohn-Anthony Disotto is TechRadar's Senior Writer, AI, bringing you the latest news on, and comprehensive coverage of, tech's biggest buzzword.

That was confirmed in a post on X by\nthe Department of Health and Human Services\n, which is now led by\nlongtime anti-vaccine crusader, Robert F. Kennedy Jr\n. However, Mark Zaid, who said he is one of the lawyers representing Monarez,\nresponded by posting\n, “Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor yet been fired. She will not resign,” and the following statement:\nRelated\nDeath is the policy\nRFK Jr. is coming for your vaccines\nThe Post says Monarez was “pressed for days” by Kennedy about whether she would support reworking the FDA’s policies. The\nPost\nreports that “at least three top CDC officials” have announced plans to resign, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and Debra Houry, chief medical officer.\nAfter\npreviewing the update in May\n, the government removed healthy pregnant people and children from its list of people recommended to receive the covid vaccine, which\nCNN reports has already\nprevented some people from getting vaccinated.\nIn a\ntweet\n, Kennedy claims the actions will “keep vaccines available to people who want them, especially the vulnerable,” however, they could now require millions of Americans to prove they are at risk, putting an additional hurdle in the way of getting vaccinated.\nThe New York Times\nreports\nthat an upcoming CDC decision could impact availability and access at drugstore sites, as laws in some states require the CDC’s recommendation for pharmacy staff to administer the shots.

    "topic": "With India’s corporate banking lagging decades behind consumer fintech, TransBnk raises $25M to bridge the gap",
    "source": "While digitization has transformed banking for Indian consumers, corporate banking has been left in the slow lane — still relying heavily on clunky infrastructure, paper trails, and spreadsheet-heavy workflows.\nTransBnk\nwants to address that gap, and Bessemer Venture Partners has invested in the three-year-old startup in a $25 million round to accelerate its progress.\nOver the past decade, India has experienced a significant boom in consumer fintech, driven by transformative shifts such as the rise of digital payments through the government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the proliferation of payment aggregators. However, these innovations have done little to enhance the experience for businesses, especially in transaction banking, where payments, collections, and even account statements still rely on manual processes. Business customers often juggle multiple internet banking portals and rely on spreadsheets for reconciliation. This gap persists despite India being the\nworld’s largest small and medium enterprise (SME) market\n, with\nnearly 75 million SMEs\n— all of which would benefit from more modern financial infrastructure.\nThe untapped potential in corporate banking represents a lucrative opportunity. India’s B2B fintech industry is projected to reach a\nmarket size of $20 billion by 2030\n, according to a February 2024 report by Chiratae Ventures and The Digital Fifth. The country is\nalready home to 26 fintech unicorns\nwith a combined market value of $90 billion, per data analyzed by JM Financial last year. However, most of these startups have focused primarily on innovations in payments and lending rather than core banking infrastructure.\nMumbai-based TransBnk, co-founded by former bankers Vaibhav Tambe, Lavin Kotian, Pulak Jain, and Sachin Gupta, positions itself in this space with what it calls a “common operating system” — a single window through which businesses can access the banking ecosystem. It offers a foundational layer of microservices, enabling use cases such as treasury, liquidity, and escrow management to be built upon.\n“During our banking days, we always got a lot of customers asking us for a single, consolidated platform for transaction banking or corporate banking on a single particular stack,” said Tambe, co-founder and CEO, in an interview. “And we thought, let’s take up this challenge… The idea was that can we consolidate and integrate with multiple banks and then create a single platform, be it in the form factors, like the web interface or mobile app, or maybe SDKs, or API?”\nFounded in 2022, the startup says it right now works with 60 banks, with 40 fully integrated into its platform to process transactions, payments, and even the core functionality reconciliation. It also has 220 customers, of which 80% are merchants, including lenders, fintechs, and non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), while the remaining 20% are banks that have white-labeled its software to provide corporate banking services to their customers.\nGlobally, companies like Finastra, Temenos, and Infosys’ Finacle are helping modernize banking through software platforms. In the U.S., players like Treasury Prime offer embedded banking solutions for enterprise customers. But in India, startups in this domain remain few and far between.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

It also requires close relationships with banks to access and build upon their data and workflows.\nOver the past year, TransBnk says that it has grown its revenue more than 12x, reaching around $12 million in annual recurring revenue. The startup says it turned profitable after taxes in February and what it describes as healthy gross margins of roughly 80%. The company states that it enables around 110 million transactions monthly, covering 11,000 bank accounts and utilizing over 1,500 APIs.\nThe Series B funding round, which includes $4 million in secondary, also saw participation from Fundamentum, Arkam Ventures, 8i Ventures, Accion, and Japan’s GMO Venture Partners. The startup plans to expand beyond India and enter markets such as Southeast Asia and the Middle East, continuing to build its infrastructure platform layer. It also intends to expand its reach to sectors including real estate, pharma, and renewable energy, Tambe told TechCrunch.\nWith the latest funding, TransBnk has raised around $26 million in total.

This gap persists despite India being the\nworld’s largest small and medium enterprise (SME) market\n, with\nnearly 75 million SMEs\n— all of which would benefit from more modern financial infrastructure.\nThe untapped potential in corporate banking represents a lucrative opportunity. India’s B2B fintech industry is projected to reach a\nmarket size of $20 billion by 2030\n, according to a February 2024 report by Chiratae Ventures and The Digital Fifth. The country is\nalready home to 26 fintech unicorns\nwith a combined market value of $90 billion, per data analyzed by JM Financial last year. However, most of these startups have focused primarily on innovations in payments and lending rather than core banking infrastructure.\nMumbai-based TransBnk, co-founded by former bankers Vaibhav Tambe, Lavin Kotian, Pulak Jain, and Sachin Gupta, positions itself in this space with what it calls a “common operating system” — a single window through which businesses can access the banking ecosystem.",

As it's less than a previous rumor indicated,\nwhich was 154 CUs\n. However, this is a bit of a 'how long is a piece of string' question as there's a whole load of variables involved, including how much difference the new architecture makes to the overall performance of AMD's next-gen GPUs, and how much cache is used (with some big increases potentially in the cards there, Kepler notes elsewhere).\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nHowever, all rumors suggest that AMD is making significant changes to the next generation of its Radeon graphics cards, which is why they\nmight adopt\nthe UDNA architecture\nrather than RDNA 5. The 'U' of UDNA refers to a 'unified' architecture, as this would supposedly represent the joining of RDNA (gaming) and CDNA (data center) architectures, all under one umbrella - a huge move.\nSo, in some ways, it makes sense that AMD would be planning a power move in terms of a proper flagship graphics card, given such a major shift in its GPU landscape. And so it's easy to believe that the intention will be to compete with the top-end of\nNvidia\n's GeForce range.\nGenerally speaking, then, trying to pin down the spec of the possible RX 10090 XT (the logical progression for naming, although I think the flagship will be called something entirely different) at this point is a waste of time. That spec is likely to be fluid and changing, anyway, as we are some way off the realization of AMD's next-gen Radeon products (which are slated to arrive late in 2026, if not 2027).\nAll we need to know is that it's looking increasingly like AMD is going to offer a compelling rival to the\nRTX 5090\n(as previous performance estimations have broadly suggested).\nAlthough it is conceivable that Nvidia may have an RTX 6090, or equivalent, on the table by the time the next-gen Radeon flagship turns up, Team Red should beat its rival to the punch based on current chatter from the grapevine. And indeed, maybe this could spur Nvidia into making an RTX 5090 Super, but I'm getting carried away with the wild speculation (and besides, such a GPU would cut into the supply of chips that Team Green could use for much more profitable AI graphics cards).\nSuffice it to say that AMD is looking towards producing a very powerful GPU with its next-gen range, one that'll please enthusiast gamers with plenty of money to spend - and Nvidia will have to sit up and take notice of that, should these rumors pan out. Especially if AMD can undercut with pricing, which shouldn't be too big an ask given how much Nvidia demands for its top dog GeForce graphics card.\nYou might also like\nThe best AMD graphics card in 2025: top GPUs from Team Red\nThe GPU market is an absolute mess right now, and I don't blame console players for staying away\nTop gaming PCs: great rigs for serious PC gaming\nSee more Computing News\nTOPICS\nAMD\nDarren Allan\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

    "source": "The Trump administration seems intent on controlling Intel’s ability to make key business decisions around its floundering foundry business unit. According to reporting from the Financial Times, at a Deutsche Bank conference on Thursday, Intel’s CFO David Zinsner shared new details about the company’s recent deal with the Trump administration, which gave the U.S. government a 10% equity stake. The deal was structured in a way to penalize Intel if it spins out its foundry business unit, which makes custom chips for outside customers, within the next few years. Last week’s deal included a five-year warrant that would allow the U.S. government to take an additional 5% of Intel, at $20 a share, if the company held less than 51% equity in its foundry business. Zinsner said he expects that warrant to expire. “I think from the government’s perspective, they were aligned with that; they didn’t want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody,” he said. Zinsner added that the company received $5.7 billion in cash on Wednesday, as a result of last week’s deal, according to Reuters. (That cash comes from the remaining grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.)

But there were a number of mammoth species, including less furry ones that inhabited temperate regions. And the furry ones include at least three species: the Eurasian steppe mammoth, the Arctic-specializing woolly mammoth, and the late-evolving North America-only Columbian mammoth. Because these species inhabited the Arctic, it has been remarkably easy to obtain DNA from them, providing a genetic picture of their relations. The DNA suggests that the woolly mammoth is an offshoot of the steppe mammoth lineage, and was the first to migrate into North America. But the Columbian mammoth was a bit of an enigma; some genetic data suggested it was also a steppe offshoot, while other samples indicated it might be a woolly/steppe hybrid. But all of that data came from animals living in colder environments. In contrast, the Columbian mammoth ranged as far south as Central America. And now, a group of researchers has managed to obtain a bit of genetic information from bones found in the Basin of Mexico, which includes Mexico City.

In his short time at Meta, according to those sources, Mayer oversaw AI data operations teams but wasn’t part of the company’s TBD Labs — the core unit within Meta tasked with building AI superintelligence, where top AI researchers from OpenAI have landed.\nHowever, Mayer disputes some details about his role, telling TechCrunch that his initial position was “to help set up the lab, with whatever was needed” rather than data, and that he was “part of TBD Labs from day one” rather than being excluded from the core AI unit. Mayer also clarified that he “did not report directly to [Wang]” and was “very happy” with his Meta experience.\nBeyond the personnel changes, Meta’s relationship with Scale AI appears to be shifting. TBD Labs is working with third-party data labeling vendors other than Scale AI to train its upcoming AI models, according to five people familiar with the matter. Those third-party vendors include Mercor and Surge, two of Scale AI’s largest competitors, the people said.\nWhile AI labs commonly work with several data labeling vendors – Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge since before TBD Labs was spun up –  it’s rare for an AI lab to invest so heavily in one data vendor. That makes this situation especially notable: even with Meta’s multi-billion-dollar investment, several sources said that researchers in TBD Labs see Scale AI’s data as low quality and have expressed a preference to work with Surge and Mercor.\nScale AI initially built its business on a crowdsourcing model that used a large, low-cost workforce to handle simple data labeling, which is the process of tagging and annotating raw information to train AI models. But as AI models have grown more sophisticated, they now require highly-skilled domain experts—such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists—to generate and refine the high-quality data needed to improve their performance.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Surge and Mercor declined to comment. Asked about Meta’s deepening reliance on competing data providers, a Scale AI spokesperson directed TechCrunch to its\ninitial announcement\nof Meta’s investment in the startup, which cites an expansion of the companies’ commercial relationship.\nMeta’s deals with third-party data vendors likely mean the company is not putting all its eggs in Scale AI, even after investing billions in the startup. The same can’t be said for Scale AI, however. Not long after Meta announced its massive investment with Scale AI,\nOpenAI\nand\nGoogle\nsaid they would stop working with the data provider.\nShortly after losing those customers, Scale AI laid off\n200 employees in its data labeling\nbusiness in July, with the company’s new CEO, Jason Droege, blaming the changes in part on “shifts in market demand.” Droege said Scale AI would staff up in other parts of the business, including government sales — the company just landed a\n$99 million contract\nwith the U.S. Army.\nSome speculated initially that Meta’s investment in Scale AI was really to lure Wang, a founder who has operated in the AI space since Scale AI was founded in 2016 and who appears to be helping Meta to attract top AI talent.\nAside from Wang, there’s an open question around how valuable Scale is to Meta.\nOne current MSL employee says that several of the Scale executives brought over to Meta are not working on the core TBD Labs team.\nMeanwhile, Meta’s AI unit has become increasingly chaotic since bringing on Wang and a wave of top researchers, according to two former employees and one current MSL employee. New talent from OpenAI and Scale AI have expressed frustration with navigating the bureaucracy of a big company, while Meta’s previous GenAI team has seen its scope limited, they said.\nThe tensions indicate that Meta’s largest AI investment to date may be off to a rocky start, despite that it was supposed to address the company’s AI development challenges. After the lackluster launch of\nLlama 4\nin April, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew frustrated with the company’s AI team, one current and one former employee told TechCrunch.\nIn an effort to turn things around and catch up with OpenAI and Google, Zuckerberg rushed to strike deals and launched an aggressive campaign to recruit top AI talent.\nBeyond Wang, Zuckerberg has managed to pull in top AI researchers from\nOpenAI\n, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. Meta has also acquired AI voice startups including\nPlay AI\nand\nWaveForms AI\n, and announced a partnership with the AI image generation startup,\nMidjourney\n.\nTo power its AI ambitions, Meta recently announced several massive data center buildouts across the U.S. One of the largest is a\n$50 billion data center\nin Louisiana called Hyperion, named after a titan in Greek mythology that fathered the God of Sun.\nWang, who’s not an AI researcher by background, was viewed as a somewhat\nunconventional choice\nto lead an AI lab. Zuckerberg reportedly held talks to bring in more traditional candidates to lead the effort, such as OpenAI’s chief research officer,\nMark Chen\n, and tried to acquire the startups of\nIlya Sutskever\nand\nMira Murati\n. All of them declined.\nSome of the new AI researchers recently brought in from OpenAI have\nalready left Meta\n, Wired previously reported. Meanwhile, many longtime members of Meta’s GenAI unit have departed in light of the changes.\nMSL AI researcher Rishabh Agarwal is among the latest,\nposting on X\nthis week that he’d be leaving the company.\n“The pitch from Mark and @alexandr_wang to build in the Superintelligence team was incredibly compelling,” said Agarwal. “But I ultimately choose to follow Mark’s own advice: ‘In a world that’s changing so fast, the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk’.”\nAsked afterward about his time at Meta and what drove his decision to leave, Agarwal declined to comment.\nDirector of product management for generative AI,\nChaya Nayak\n, and research engineer,\nRohan Varma\n, have also announced their departure from Meta in recent weeks. The question now is whether Meta can stabilize its AI operations and retain the talent it needs for its future success.\nMSL has already started working on its next generation AI model. According to reports from\nBusiness Insider\n, it’s aiming to launch it by the end of this year.\nUpdate: This story has been updated with comments from Mayer, who reached out to TechCrunch after publication.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nAI model\n,\nalexandr wang\n,\nMark Zuckerberg\n,\nMeta\n,\nscale\nMaxwell Zeff\nSenior AI Reporter\nMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

Complexity itself has become the enterprise’s greatest cybersecurity vulnerability.\nPlatform vendors have been selling consolidation for years, capitalizing on the chaos and complexity that app and tool sprawl create. As George Kurtz, CEO of\nCrowdStrike\n, explained in a recent\nVentureBeat interview\nabout competing with a platform in today’s mercurially changing market conditions: “The difference between a platform and platformization is execution. You need to deliver immediate value while building toward a unified vision that eliminates complexity.”\nCrowdStrike’s Charlotte AI\nautomates alert triage\nand saves SOC teams over\n40 hours every week\nby classifying millions of detections at\n98%\naccuracy; that equals the output of five seasoned analysts and is fueled by Falcon Complete’s expert-labeled incident corpus.\n“We couldn’t have done this without our Falcon Complete team,” Elia Zaitsev, CTO at CrowdStrike, told\nVentureBeat\nin a recent interview. “They do triage as part of their workflow, manually handling millions of detections. That high-quality, human-annotated dataset is what made over 98% accuracy possible. We recognized that adversaries are increasingly leveraging AI to accelerate attacks.

This spending surge reflects an asymmetric battlefield where attackers deploy gen AI to simultaneously target thousands of employees with personalized campaigns crafted from real-time scraped data.\nAttackers are making the most of the advantages they’re getting from adversarial AI, with speed, stealth and highly personalized, target attacks becoming the most lethal. “For years, attackers have been utilizing AI to their advantage,” Mike Riemer, Field CISO at\nIvanti\n, told\nVentureBeat\n. “However, 2025 will mark a turning point as defenders begin to harness the full potential of AI for cybersecurity purposes.”\nCaption: 55% of security leaders expect budget increases above 5% in 2026, with Asia Pacific organizations leading at 22% expecting increases above 10% versus just 9% in North America. Source:\nForrester’s 2026 Budget Planning Guide\nRegional spending disparities reveal threat landscape variations and how CISOs are responding to them. Asia Pacific organizations lead with\n22%\nexpecting budget increases above 10% versus just\n9%\nin North America.\nCloud security, on-premises technology and security awareness training\ntop investment priorities globally.\nSoftware dominates budgets as runtime defenses become critical in 2026\nVentureBeat continues to hear from security leaders about how crucial protecting the inference layer of AI model development is. Many consider it the new frontline of the future of cybersecurity. Inference layers are vulnerable to prompt injection, data exfiltration, or even direct model manipulation. These are all threats that demand millisecond-scale responses, not delayed forensic investigations.\nForrester’s latest CISO spending guide underscores a profound shift in cybersecurity spending priorities, with cloud security leading all spending increases at\n12%\n, closely followed by investments in on-premises security technology at\n11%\n, and security awareness initiatives at\n10%\n. These priorities reflect the urgency CISOs feel to strengthen defenses precisely at the critical moment of AI model inference.\n“At Reputation, security is baked into our core architecture and enforced rigorously at runtime,” Carter Rees, Vice President of Artificial Intelligence at\nReputation\n, recently told VentureBeat. “The inference layer, the exact moment an AI model interacts with people, data, or tools, is where we apply our most stringent controls. Every interaction includes authenticated tenant and role contexts, verified in real-time by an AI security gateway.”\nReputation’s multi-tiered approach has become a de facto gold standard, blending proactive and reactive defenses. “Real-time controls immediately take over,” Rees explained. “Our prompt firewall blocks unauthorized or off-topic inputs instantly, restricting tool and data access strictly to user permissions. Behavioral detectors proactively flag anomalies the moment they occur.”\nThis rigorous runtime security approach extends equally into customer-facing systems. “For natural language interactions, our AI only pulls from explicitly customer-approved sources,” Rees noted. “Each generated response must transparently cite its sources. We verify citations match both tenant and context, routing for human review if they do not.”\nQuantum computing’s accelerating risk\nQuantum computing is quickly evolving from a theoretical concern into an immediate enterprise threat. Security leaders now face “harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL) attacks, where adversaries store encrypted data for future quantum-enabled decryption. Widely used encryption methods like 2048-bit RSA risk compromise once quantum processors reach operational scale with tens of thousands of reliable qubits.\nThe\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nfinalized three critical Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards in August 2024, mandating encryption algorithm retirement by 2030 and full prohibition by 2035. Global agencies, including\nAustralia’s Signals Directorate\n, require PQC implementation by 2030.\nForrester urges organizations to prioritize PQC adoption for protecting sensitive data at rest, in transit, and in use. Security leaders should leverage cryptographic inventory and discovery tools, partnering with cryptoagility providers such as\nEntrust\n,\nIBM\n,\nKeyfactor\n,\nPalo Alto Networks\n,\nQuSecure\n,\nSandboxAQ\n, and\nThales\n. Given quantum’s rapid progression, CISOs need to factor in how they’ll update encryption strategies to avoid obsolescence and vulnerability.\nExplosion of identities is fueling an AI-driven credential crisis\nMachine identities now outnumber human users by a staggering\n45:1 ratio\n, fueling a credential crisis beyond human management. Forrester’s\nguide\nunderscores scaling\nmachine identity management\nas mission-critical to mitigating emerging threats. Gartner forecasts identity security spending to nearly double, reaching\n$47.1 billion by 2028\n.\nTraditional endpoint approaches aren’t capable of slowing down a growing onslaught of adversarial AI attacks. Ivanti’s Daren Goeson recently told VentureBeat: “As these endpoints multiply, so does their vulnerability. Combining AI with\nUnified Endpoint Management\n(UEM) is increasingly essential.”\nIvanti’s\nAI-driven\nVulnerability Risk Rating (VRR)\nillustrates this benefit, enabling organizations to patch vulnerabilities 85% faster by identifying threats traditional scoring methods overlook, making AI-driven credential intelligence enterprise security at scale.\n“Endpoint devices such as laptops, desktops, smartphones, and IoT devices are essential to modern business operations. However, as their numbers grow, so do the opportunities for attackers to exploit endpoints and their applications, ”Goeson explained.  “Factors like an expanded attack surface, insufficient security resources, unpatched vulnerabilities, and outdated software contribute to this rising risk. By adopting a comprehensive approach that combines UEM solutions with AI-powered tools, businesses significantly reduce their cyber risk and the impact of attacks,” Goeson advised VentureBeat during a recent interview.\nDivesting legacy tools continues to accelerate\nForrester saves their immediate call to action in the guide for advising security leaders to begin divesting legacy security tools immediately, with a specific focus on interactive application security testing (IAST), standalone cybersecurity risk-rating (CRR) products, and fragmented Security Service Edge (SSE), SD-WAN, and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions.\nInstead, Forrester advises, security leaders need to prioritize more integrated platforms that enhance visibility and streamline management. Unified Secure Access Service Edge (\nSASE\n) solutions from\nPalo Alto Networks\nand\nNetskope\nnow provide essential consolidation. At the same time, integrated Third-Party Risk Management (\nTPRM\n) and continuous monitoring platforms from\nUpGuard\n,\nPanorays\nand\nRiskRecon\nreplace standalone CRR tools the consulting firm advises.\nAdditionally, automated remediation powered by\nMicrosoft’s MDVM\nwith\nIntune\n,\nTanium’s endpoint management\n, and DevOps-focused solutions like\nMondoo\nhas emerged as a critical capability for real-time threat neutralization.\nCISOs must consolidate security at AI’s inference edge or risk losing control\nConsolidating tools at inference’s edge is the future of cybersecurity, especially as AI threats intensify. “For CISOs, the playbook is crystal clear,” Rees concluded. “Consolidate controls decisively at the inference edge. Introduce robust behavioral anomaly detection. Strengthen Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with provenance checks and defined abstain paths. Above all, invest heavily in runtime defenses and support the specialized teams who operate them. Execute this playbook, and you achieve secure AI deployments at true scale.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "source": "Words matter\nThe fight against labeling long-term streaming rentals as “purchases” you “buy”\nNew law emboldens complaints against digital content rentals labled as purchases.\nScharon Harding\n–\nAug 29, 2025 5:51 pm\n|\n100\nCredit:\nGetty\nCredit:\nGetty\nText\n        settings\nStory text\nSize\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\n*\nStandard\nWide\nLinks\nStandard\nOrange\n* Subscribers only\nLearn more\nMinimize to nav\nWords have meaning. Proper word selection is integral to strong communication, whether it's about relaying one’s feelings to another or explaining the terms of a deal, agreement, or transaction.\nLanguage can be confusing, but typically when something is available to \"buy,\" ownership of that good or access to that service is offered in exchange for money. That’s not really the case, though, when it comes to digital content.\nOften, streaming services like Amazon Prime Video offer customers the options to “rent” digital content for a few days or to “buy” it. Some might think that picking \"buy\" means that they can view the content indefinitely. But these purchases are really just long-term licenses to watch the content for as long as the streaming service has the right to distribute it—which could be for years, months, or days after the transaction.\nA lawsuit\n[PDF]\nrecently filed against Prime Video challenges this practice and accuses the streaming service of misleading customers by labeling long-term rentals as purchases. The conclusion of the case could have implications for how streaming services frame digital content.\nNew lawsuit against Prime Video\nOn August 21, Lisa Reingold filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California against Amazon, alleging \"false and misleading advertising.\" The complaint, citing\nPrime Video’s terms of use\n, reads:\nOn its website, Defendant tells consumers the option to 'buy' or 'purchase' digital copies of these audiovisual works. But when consumers 'buy' digital versions of audiovisual works through Amazon’s website, they do not obtain the full bundle of sticks of rights we traditionally think of as owning property. Instead, they receive 'non-exclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, limited license' to access the digital audiovisual work, which is maintained at Defendant’s sole discretion.\nThe complaint compares buying a movie from Prime Video to buying one from a physical store. It notes that someone who buys a DVD can view the movie a decade later, but “the same cannot be said,\" necessarily, if they purchased the film on Prime Video. Prime Video may remove the content or replace it with a different version, such as a shorter theatrical cut.\nAmazon has fought this fight before\nIn 2020, Amanda Caudel filed a similar complaint\n[PDF]\nin the same court as Reingold. Caudel's complaint argued that Amazon “secretly reserves the right to terminate the consumers’ access and use of the Video Content at any time, and has done so on numerous occasions, leaving the consumer without the ability to enjoy their already-bought Video Content.”\nCaudel's case was dismissed\n[PDF]\nin October 2021 with the judge ruling that the plaintiff lacked “standing.”\nCalifornia law reignites debate\nDespite the dismissal of similar litigation years ago, Reingold's complaint stands a better chance due to\na California law\nthat took effect in January banning the selling of a \"digital good to a purchaser with the terms ‘buy,’ ‘purchase,' or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good, or alongside an option for a time-limited rental.”\nThere are some instances where the law allows digital content providers to use words like \"buy.\" One example is if, at the time of transaction, the seller receives acknowledgement from the customer that the customer is receiving a license to access the digital content; that they received a complete list of the license's conditions; and that they know that access to the digital content may be \"unilaterally revoked.\"\nA seller can also use words like \"buy\" if it provides to the customer ahead of the transaction a statement that \"states in plain language that 'buying' or 'purchasing' the digital good is a license,\" as well as online access to terms and conditions, the law states.\nThe California legislation helps strengthen the lawsuit filed by Reingold, a California resident. The case is likely to hinge on whether or not fine print and lengthy terms of use are appropriate and sufficient communication.\nReingold's complaint acknowledges that Prime Video shows relevant fine print below its \"buy\" buttons but says that the notice is “far below the ‘buy movie’ button, buried at the very bottom” of the page and is not visible until “the very last stage of the transaction,” after a user has already clicked “buy.”\n“This does not meet the standards set by the statute for a clear and conspicuous notice that the thing they are purchasing is a revocable license to access the digital good,” the complaint reads.\nSpeaking about the case with Ars Technica,\nDanny Karon\n, a\nconsumer attorney\nwho has taught class-action litigation at the University of Michigan Law School and Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, said:\n… Amazon is sure to argue that, never mind its ‘buy’ or ‘purchase’ language, the rest of the story was described (or buried) in its terms and conditions. If plaintiff didn’t want to read her contract, including the small print, that’s on her.\nThe plaintiffs will be challenged to prove that Amazon's communication was ineffective and inaccurate.\n\"One has to prove that when they bought the movie, they were given indication that they 'owned it' in perpetuity and that they were harmed when the movie was taken away,\"\nRahul Telang\n, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College who has researched the digitization of copyrighted industries, told Ars.\n\"I think it is well established that digital products are licensed and they cannot be used as physical products. One has to prove that Amazon provided false information that they were buying a product ...\"\nKaron, pointing to Amazon’s choice of words, told Ars: “I like plaintiff’s chances.” He explained:\nA normal consumer, after whom the California statute at issue is fashioned, would consider ‘buy’ or ‘purchase’ to involve a permanent transaction, not a mere rental, as is occurring here. If the facts are as plaintiff alleges, Amazon’s behavior would likely constitute a breach of contract or statutory fraud.\nThe attorney added that such complaints could be more viable if the content purchased from the plaintiffs was removed from the service.\nThe complaint requests a jury trial and is seeking unspecified damages, including the disgorgement of relevant profits.\nA break in communication\nThe two lawsuits against Prime Video highlight consequential gaps in understanding among people who spend money on digital content. Both cases could contribute to potential changes in how the streaming industry describes digital content transcations moving forward. Prime Video is the target of both suits discussed, but other streaming companies, such as YouTube, also use the word “buy” when selling long-term licenses for digital content.\nStreaming is now the\nmost popular way to watch TV\n, yet many are unaware of what they’re buying. As Reingold's lawsuit points out, paying for content in the streaming era is different from buying media from physical stores. Physical media nets control over your ability to watch stuff for years. But you also had to have retrieved the media from a store (or website) and to have maintained that physical copy, as well the necessary hardware and/or software for playing it. Streaming services can rip purchased content from customers\nin bulk\n, but they also offer access to a much broader library that's instantly watchable with technology that most already have (like a TV and Internet).\nWe can debate the best approach to distributing media. What's clearer is the failure of digital content providers to ensure that customers fully understand they’re paying for access to content, and that this\naccess could be revoked at any time\n.\nThere’s an argument to be made for thoughtful word choices that communicate clearly to customers. Ars asked Amazon if it might change its word choices on Prime Video to avoid the potential confusion embodied by the aforementioned lawsuits. We didn’t receive a response.\nScharon Harding\nSenior Technology Reporter\nScharon Harding\nSenior Technology Reporter\nScharon is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica writing news, reviews, and analysis on consumer gadgets and services.

That’s not really the case, though, when it comes to digital content.\nOften, streaming services like Amazon Prime Video offer customers the options to “rent” digital content for a few days or to “buy” it. Some might think that picking \"buy\" means that they can view the content indefinitely. But these purchases are really just long-term licenses to watch the content for as long as the streaming service has the right to distribute it—which could be for years, months, or days after the transaction.\nA lawsuit\n[PDF]\nrecently filed against Prime Video challenges this practice and accuses the streaming service of misleading customers by labeling long-term rentals as purchases. The conclusion of the case could have implications for how streaming services frame digital content.\nNew lawsuit against Prime Video\nOn August 21, Lisa Reingold filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California against Amazon, alleging \"false and misleading advertising.\" The complaint, citing\nPrime Video’s terms of use\n, reads:\nOn its website, Defendant tells consumers the option to 'buy' or 'purchase' digital copies of these audiovisual works.",

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.\nAs one of the cofounders behind Oculus Story Studio,\nEdward Saatchi\nknows how hard it can be to sell people on new tech that bills itself as revolutionary. Even though Story Studio snagged an Emmy for one of its three animated features, a general lack of public interest in VR movies led\nMeta to shutter Oculus Story Studio\nback in 2017. The VR era has come and gone, but Saatchi is confident that\nShowrunner\n, his new pivot to generative AI that\njust received an influx of cash from Amazon\n, can succeed.\nUnlike a lot of other gen AI-centric entertainment outfits focused on deploying the technology in ways that audiences aren’t necessarily meant to see,\nSaatchi and his team at studio Fable\ndeveloped Showrunner with the intention of people using the platform to generate content tailored to their specific desires. Currently, Showrunner lives on a Discord server where users can generate short animated videos by selecting characters and art styles from a list, and then writing prompts dictating what those characters say and how they interact with the environments around them.\nAfter being told that you want to see Elon Musk and Sam Altman standing in an office break room and having a conversation about turning homelessness into a software as a service, Showrunner will generate a clip that mostly fits that description. Showrunner’s clips are all styled to match the aesthetics of one of the platform’s preset shows, like\nExit Valley\n, a cartoon that appears to be a cross between\nSilicon Valley\nand\nFamily Guy.\nThe characters’ awkward, AI-generated voices are meant to sound like the real people they are based on. And they tend to be animated with an odd stiffness that makes it clear how much of Showrunner’s output is automated by machines rather than crafted by experienced human artists.\nAn Exit Valley clip featuring the likenesses of Donald Trump and Abraham Lincoln.\nFor now, the service is free, but Fable intends to start charging subscribers somewhere between $10–$20 per month at some point in the future. And while Showrunner is currently limited to generating output based on its own catalog of original programming, other studios like Disney have reportedly expressed\ninterest in licensing their IP to the platform\n.\nWhen I spoke with Saatchi recently, he admitted to being a bit too high on his own supply during his time with Oculus and deeply humbled when that version of the company ultimately came to an end. That whiplash left him reconsidering what consumers really want out of their entertainment, and it convinced him that the answers lie in gen AI.\n”You have no idea how arrogant we were right after Meta acquired Oculus, but I remember being in meetings across Hollywood to show off our ideas, and we were just like, ‘You guys are done; we’re taking over,’” Saatchi told me. “But our net impact on the industry was zero in the end, and our revenue from VR movies was probably $10.”\nTo Saatchi’s mind, the big issue with VR was that it kept users in a kind of limbo where they were expected to be both passive and interactive depending on which scenes they were watching. Alternating between those two modes of engagement, Saatchi told me, was part of Oculus’ plan to make its projects feel like crosses between traditional movies and video games. But Saatchi’s own disinterest in watching VR movies was a clear sign to him that the technology was a dead end he should move on from in favor of something more dynamic.\nSaatchi’s interest in gen AI was actually sparked by a technical roadblock he and his collaborators ran into while developing\na VR adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s 2003 children’s book,\nWolves in the Walls\n. In both tellings of the story, a young girl named Lucy lives in constant fear of the wolves living in the walls of her house, while her family insists that the creatures aren’t real. Saatchi and his team wanted their version of Lucy to be able to have fluent conversations with players / viewers as she guided them through the various rooms in her house. But the character was limited to reciting canned bits of dialogue rather than responding with context-specific speech.\nThis hurdle got Saatchi thinking more seriously about how he might be able to build Lucy as a complex “digital being” capable of\nhaving complicated interactions with people\n. That concept put Saatchi on a path to working with a team from OpenAI to see if it was possible. It wasn’t, not really. But the experience of building a slightly more robust Lucy character convinced Saatchi that generative AI could be the key to creating a new kind of entertainment experience.\n“We made Lucy into a character that you can talk to and video chat with,” Saatchi said. “But what we quickly realized is that if you want to make a character truly live — which became our big goal — then you have to build a simulation of their world. They can’t just be a brain in a jar, like one character by themselves. They have to have a family, they have to have a life.”\nThe idea of building simulations — sandboxed virtual environments defined by specific rules — to make AI characters feel more multifaceted by giving them contexts to exist in is what led to Showrunner using its SHOW-1 model to produce a series of\nunlicensed\nSouth Park\nepisodes\n.\nShowrunner could approximate\nSouth Park\n’s visual style and musical cues, but it struggled to re-create the show’s comedic patter or the kind of chemistry between characters that, traditionally, is rooted in human actors’ performances. Also, the ersatz\nSouth Park\njust wasn’t funny, and it felt more like poorly written fanfiction than episodes of television that people might actually want to watch. But to Saatchi, the experiment demonstrated that Showrunner could be fashioned into a service — one dedicated to giving its users a way to prompt up “shows” of their own, one AI generated scene at a time.\nSaatchi speaks about Showrunner the way many pro-gen AI founders do — with an optimistic enthusiasm that doesn’t exactly feel justified when you look at what the platform is currently capable of churning out. He sees it as the “Netflix of AI” and thinks that, with enough users writing the right prompts, it could produce something comparable to\nThe Simpsons\n,\nEuphoria,\nor\nToy Story\n. But Saatchi also believes the real appeal to Showrunner is its ability to create entertainment that’s more interactive than traditional films and shows.\n“We think the\nToy Story\nof AI isn’t going to be a cheaply produced animated movie, it’s going to be something that’s playable,” Saatchi told me. “Most people feel that generative AI is a tool to make the same, but cheaper, and we’re trying to say it’s a new kind of medium. Cinema was not about saving theater owners money; it was highly disruptive and took years to explore as a medium. I feel like the industry is kind of cutting off that exploratory element with generative AI by just shoving it into movies.”\nWhen I brought up the ongoing conversation about gen AI’s potential to put\npeople in creative fields out of work\n, Saatchi said what almost everyone in his position says — that he sees Showrunner as a platform that’s meant to supplement traditionally produced entertainment rather than replace it. He told me that he finds the idea of studios embracing this kind of technology strictly for cost-saving reasons rather grim. Saatchi also stressed that, while Showrunner is built on a number of LLMs, the company works with human artists and animators to develop its visual assets “because something is just clearly lost without that.”\n“I don’t think there’s any papering over the fact that AI is going to cut jobs, but that’s why we’re not very interested in the whole cheaper VFX paradigm that most other folks are going after,” Saatchi explained. “If all that we can do with such a powerful technology is just cut jobs, what was the point? Nobody’s gonna go to the cinema to say, ‘I heard this was the\nToy Story\nof AI. I’ve really got to get my ticket because it’s so cool that they spent so little on this.’”\nWhat Saatchi does think people will be willing to pay for is the ability to generate scenes based on licensed IP. Though Showrunner’s core use case right now is making short, unpolished clips based on Fable’s in-house properties, the company ultimately wants to partner with major studios like Disney to develop branded models that would allow, for example, you to prompt up scenes featuring characters from\nThe Mandalorian.\nThis would “give people a way to create millions of new scenes, thousands of episodes, or even their own movies,” Saatchi reasoned.\n”Our idea would be that, instead of people getting excited about\nstormtroopers in ancient Rome\n, which is, like, a cheap concept, there’s a\nStar Wars\nmodel that 700 people have developed under Dave Filoni’s direction,” Saatchi said. “These models would have real characters and a world that could be explored through prompting, and you could also inadvertently trigger scenes within those worlds in a way that would make it feel as though you’re uncovering something unknown.”\nA clip from Fable’s\nEverything Is Fine\n.\nThroughout our conversation, Saatchi was insistent about Showrunner being a good thing and a revolutionary tool designed to give users a new way of engaging with media. But he agreed when I pointed out that the system he’s describing makes it sound like Showrunner would effectively turn its subscribers into unpaid employees working for some of Hollywood’s biggest and most powerful studios. Studios would own anything generated with Showrunner’s branded models trained on copyrighted IP, and users will eventually have to pay to use the service.\nBut Saatchi stressed that, while Showrunner definitely wants to work with companies like Disney, he is also interested in collaborating with smaller creators who would stand to benefit greatly from the company’s business model. An indie filmmaker could license their new project to Showrunner and subsequently be paid a portion of revenue share based on how many scenes people were generating with the model based on their movie. Saatchi could not give me a timeline on when Showrunner might start trying to establish those kinds of partnerships, but he was bullish about them being part of what makes the platform a boon to independent creators.\n“This could create something where creators can earn money when people are emotionally connected enough to their work that they themselves want to make something with it,” Saatchi said. “Compare that to what creators earn just from people viewing their work online. Yes, there is a kind of ‘we’re all employees of Disney’ element, but from a moral point, I can’t think of a better way to do it.”\nListening to Saatchi describe what he wants Showrunner to become, it actually sounds a bit like Roblox and\nFortnite\n. Not the building or battle royale of it all, but rather the way those games encourage players to create their own maps, share them, and get other people to do the same thing. The Roblox Corporation and Epic have both built platforms where being a consumer can also essentially mean being a worker — one whose labor serves only to contribute to the corporations’ bottom lines.\nBut whereas those games are free to play, Fable very much wants people paying upfront to use Showrunner. If Showrunner were truly capable of conjuring up imaginative, detailed worlds that felt like thoughtful works of art, Saatchi’s pitch might not sound so dubious and mildly exploitative on its face. But what Fable is shopping around right now sounds like yet another attempt at using AI to do something that human artists are already quite capable of doing much, much better.\n15\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nClose\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nFilm & TV Reporter\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nAI\nClose\nAI\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAI\nEntertainment\nClose\nEntertainment\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nEntertainment\nInterview\nClose\nInterview\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nInterview\nReport\nClose\nReport\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nReport\nTV Shows\nClose\nTV Shows\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTV Shows\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nApple iPhone 17 launch event: What to expect\nWhat’s really happening with the hires at Meta Superintelligence Labs\nMicrosoft AI launches its first in-house models\nThe best Labor Day TV sales\nFramework actually did it: I upgraded a laptop’s entire GPU in just three minutes\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

Sign up for their newsletter\nhere\n.\nSince 2022, Republican lawmakers in Congress and state attorneys general have sent letters to major\nbanks\n,\npension funds\n,\nasset managers\n,\naccounting firms\n,\ncompanies\n,\nnonprofits\n, and\nbusiness alliances\n, putting them on notice for potential antitrust violations and seeking information as part of the Republican pushback against “environmental, social and governance” efforts such as corporate climate commitments.\n“This caused a lot of turmoil and stress obviously across the whole ecosystem,” said Denise Hearn, a senior fellow at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. “But everyone wondered, ‘OK, when are they actually going to drop a lawsuit?’”\nThat\ncame in November\n, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other Republican AGs, accusing three of the biggest asset managers on Wall Street—BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street—of running “an investment cartel” to depress the output of coal and boosting their revenues while pushing up energy costs for Americans. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission filed a supporting\nbrief\nin May.\nThe overall pressure campaign aimed at what’s known as “ESG” is having an impact.\n“Over the past several months, through this [lawsuit] and other things, letters from elected officials, state and federal, there has been a chilling effect of what investors are saying,” said Steven Maze Rothstein, chief program officer of Ceres, a nonprofit that advocates for more sustainable business practices and was among the earliest letter recipients. Still, “investors understand that Mother Nature doesn’t know who’s elected governor, attorney general, president.”\nEarlier this month, a US District Court judge in Tyler, Texas,\ndeclined to dismiss\nthe lawsuit against the three asset managers, though he did dismiss three of the 21 counts. The judge was not making a final decision in the case, only that there was enough evidence to go to trial.\nBlackRock said in a statement: “This case is not supported by the facts, and we will demonstrate that.” Vanguard said it will “vigorously defend against plaintiffs’ claims.” State Street called the lawsuit “baseless and without merit.”\nThe Texas attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe three asset managers built substantial stakes in major US coal producers, the suit alleges, and “announced their common commitment” to cut US coal output by joining voluntary alliances to collaborate on climate issues, including the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and, in the case of two of the firms, the Climate Action 100+. (All of them later pulled out of the alliances.)\nThe lawsuit alleges that the coal companies succumbed to the defendants’ collective influence, mining for less coal and disclosing more climate-related information. The suit claimed that resulted in “cartel-level revenues and profits” for the asset managers.\n“You could say, ‘Well, if the coal companies were all colluding together to restrict output, then shouldn’t they also be violating antitrust?’” Hearn asked. But the attorneys general “are trying to say that it was at the behest of these concentrated index funds and the concentrated ownership.”\nIndex funds, which are designed to mirror the returns of specific market indices, are the most common mode of passive investment—when investors park their money somewhere for long-term returns.\nThe case is being watched closely, not only by climate alliances and sustainability nonprofits, but by the financial sector at large.\nIf the three asset managers ultimately win, it would turn down the heat on other climate alliances and vindicate those who pressured financial players to line up their business practices with the Paris agreement goals as well as national and local climate targets. The logic of those efforts: Companies in the financial sector have a big impact on climate change, for good or ill—and climate change has a big impact on those same companies.\nIf the red states instead win on all counts, that “could essentially totally reconstitute the industry as we understand it,” said Hearn, who has co-authored a\npaper\non the lawsuit. At stake is how the US does passive investing.\nThe pro-free-market editorial board of The Wall Street Journal in June\ncalled the Texas-led lawsuit\n“misconceived,” its logic “strained” and its theories “bizarre.”\nThe case breaks ground on two fronts. It challenges collaboration between financial players on climate action. It also makes novel claims around “common ownership,” where a shareholder—in this case, an asset manager—holds stakes in competing firms within the same sector.\n“Regardless of how the chips fall in the case, those two things will absolutely be precedent-setting,” Hearn said.\nEven though this is the first legal test of the theory that business climate alliances are anti-competitive, the question was asked in a\nstudy\nby Harvard Business School economists that came out in May. That study, which empirically examines 11 major climate alliances and 424 listed financial institutions over 10 years, turned up no evidence of traditional antitrust violations. The study was broad and did not look at particular allegations against specific firms.\n“To the extent that there are valid legal arguments that can be made, they have to be tested,” said study co-author Peter Tufano, a Harvard Business School professor, noting that his research casts doubt on many of the allegations made by critics of these alliances.\nFinancial firms that joined climate alliances were more likely to adopt emissions targets and climate-aligned management practices, cut their own emissions and engage in pro-climate lobbying, the study found.\n”The range of [legal] arguments that are made, and the passion with which they’re being advanced, suggests that these alliances must be doing something meaningful,” said Tufano, who was previously the dean of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford.\nMeanwhile, most of the world is moving the other way.\nAccording to a tally by\nCarbonCloud\n, a carbon emissions accounting platform that serves the food industry, at least 35 countries that make up more than half of the world’s gross domestic product now mandate climate-related disclosures of some kind.\nIn the US, California, which on its own would be the world’s fourth-largest economy, will begin requiring big businesses to measure and report their direct and indirect emissions next year.\nCeres’ Rothstein notes that good data about companies is necessary for informed investment decisions. “Throughout the world,” he said, “there’s greater recognition and, to be honest, less debate about the importance of climate information.” Ceres is one of the founders of Climate Action 100+, which now counts more than 600 investor members around the world, including Europe, Asia, and Australia.\nFor companies that operate globally, the American political landscape is in sharp contrast with other major economies, Tufano said, creating “this whipsawed environment where if you get on a plane, a few hours later, you’re in a jurisdiction that’s saying exactly the opposite thing.”\nBut even as companies and financial institutions publicly retreat from their climate commitments amid US political pressure, in a phenomenon called “\ngreenhushing\n,” their decisions remain driven by the bottom line. “Banks are going to do what they’re going to do, and they’re going to lend to the most profitable or to the most growth-oriented industries,” Hearn said, “and right now, that’s not the fossil fuel industry.”\nInside Climate News\nInside Climate News\n98 Comments",

That memory will come rushing back with the Floppy Disk-Inspired SD Card Packaging, a design concept created by Indian industrial designer Ayushmaan Singh Jodha for SanDisk.\nIt takes the iconic 3.5-inch floppy and reimagines it as a different kind of storage device - as a case for today’s\nSD cards\n.\nYou may like\nBeige is beautiful: Retro 1980s PC hides a GeForce RTX 5060 Ti and even has fake 5.25-inch bay covers, because why not\nI journeyed into the web archive of an iconic consumer electronics magazine – here’s what I found\nCeramic-based startup wants to put more than 100,000TB in a 42U rack by 2030 — but it will take almost 50 years to fill it up\n(Image credit: Ayushmaan Singh Jodha)\nFrom megabytes to terabytes\nWhere a floppy once held 1.44MB, this design protects cards that now carry gigabytes or even terabytes.\nThe idea bridges eras of technology in a fun way, but with a serious practical purpose.\nSD cards can easily get lost, slipping out of pockets during a shoot, hiding beneath clutter in a busy studio, or disappearing into the depths of a travel bag. I’ve lost a good number of them over the years.\nThe floppy case provides a larger, sturdier object to hold onto, making it easier to keep track of the tiny cards that store important work.\nAre you a pro?

The idea is turn the cases into collectible pieces that creatives may want to keep on display, not tucked away in drawers.\nThe sliding shutter reveals the hidden compartment where the SD card is stored, adding a small sense of interaction to an otherwise simple task.\nIs it truly practical?

Users of the likes of WeChat, Douyin, Weibo and RedNote (aka Xiaohongshu) are now seeing such labels on posts. These denote the use of generative AI in text, images, audio, video and other types of material, according to\nSouth China Morning Post\n. Identifiers such as watermarks have to be included in metadata too.\nWeChat has told users they must proactively apply labels to their AI-generated content. They're also prohibited from removing, tampering with or hiding any AI labels that WeChat applies itself, or to use \"AI to produce or spread false information, infringing content or any illegal activities.\"\nByteDance's Douyin — the Chinese version of TikTok — similarly urged users to apply a label to every post of theirs that includes AI-generated material while noting it's able to use metadata to detect where a piece of content content came from. Weibo, meanwhile, has added the option for users to report \"unlabelled AI content\" option when they see something that should have such a label.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFour agencies drafted the law — which was\nissued earlier this year\n— including the main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security and the National Radio and Television Administration also helped put together the legislation, which is being enforced to help oversee the tidal wave of genAI content.

    "source": "Scale AI, which helps tech companies prepare data to train their AI models, filed a lawsuit against one of its former sales employees and its rival Mercor on Wednesday. The suit claims the employee, who was hired by Mercor, “stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information,” according to a copy seen by TechCrunch.\nScale is suing Mercor for misappropriation of trade secrets and is suing the former employee, Eugene Ling, for breach of contract. The suit also claims the employee was trying to pitch Mercor to one of Scale’s largest customers before he officially left his former job. The suit calls this company “Customer A.”\nMercor co-founder Surya Midha denies that his company used any data from Scale, although he admits that Ling may have been in possession of some.\n“While Mercor has hired many people who departed Scale, we have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way. Eugene informed us that he had old documents in a personal Google Drive, which we have never accessed and are now investigating,” Midha told TechCrunch in an emailed statement.\n“We reached out to Scale six days ago offering to have Eugene destroy the files or reach a different resolution, and we are now awaiting their response,” Midha said.\nScale alleges that these documents contained the specific data that would allow Mercor to serve Customer A, as well as several other of Scale’s most important clients.\nScale wanted Mercor to give it a full list of the files in the drive, and to prevent Ling from working with Customer A. It alleges in the suit that Mercor refused. Ling did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The suit does say that if Scale’s rival did win this customer away, it would be a contract “worth millions of dollars to Mercor.”\nWhatever the details of this suit, it does show one thing: Scale is clearly concerned enough about the threat of Mercor to pursue legal action. As\nTechCrunch previously reported\n, even with Meta’s multibillion-dollar investment into Scale, TBD Labs — the core unit within Meta tasked with building AI superintelligence — is still using Mercor and other LLM data training service providers.\nMercor is rising in the LLM training arena because it is known for hiring content specialists, often PhDs, to train LLM data in their areas of expertise.\nIn June, Scale announced that Meta was investing $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale and was hiring away its founder. Shortly after that,\nseveral of Scale AI’s largest data customers, who are competitors to Meta’s efforts, reportedly cut ties with it\n.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nlawsuits\n,\nMercor\n,\nScale AI\n,\nTC\nJulie Bort\nVenture Editor\nJulie Bort is the Startups/Venture Desk editor for TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Julie by emailing\njulie.bort@techcrunch.com\nor via\n@Julie188\non X.\nView Bio\nOctober 27-29, 2025\nSan Francisco\nPut your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.

There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl.\nRight now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.\nIn this article\nThe best 4K TV deals for most people\nThe best 4K TV deals for those on a budget\nThe best deals on high-end 4K TVs\nRelated\nDolby Vision 2 goes beyond HDR with more AI and ‘authentic motion’ smoothing\nLG’s StanbyMe 2 is an unquestionably cool TV at a questionably high price\nApps for Google TV and Android TV must offer 64-bit versions by next August\nThe best 4K TV deals for most people\nSamsung Q8F\nSamsung’s Q8F\nis available for an all-time low of $599.99 ($150 off) at\nAmazon\nand\nBest Buy\nfor the 55-inch model, which is a solid value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.\nThe TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $402 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,597.99 at\nAmazon\nand\nBest Buy\n.\nSamsung Q8F\n$\n600\n$\n748\n20\n% off\n$\n600\n$600 at Amazon (55-Inch)\n$600 at Best Buy (55-Inch)\n$1598 at Amazon (85-Inch)\nIf you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at\nAmazon\nand\nBest Buy\nfor an all-time low of around $596.99 ($403 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing.\nThe U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.\nAs for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for around $797.99 ($502 off) at\nAmazon\nand\nBest Buy\n.\nHisense U65QF TV (2025)\n$\n597\n$\n1000\n40\n% off\n$\n597\n$597 at Amazon (65-inch)\n$600 at Best Buy (65-inch)\n$798 at Amazon (75-inch)\nThe best 4K TV deals for those on a budget\nAmazon Fire TV 4-Series\nAmazon’s Fire TV 4-Series\nis an affordable option if you want to upgrade a smaller HDTV to a 4K model. The 50-inch model is currently on sale for $289.99 ($110 off) at\nAmazon\n. The TV features an LED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and support for HDR10 / HLG, which is totally sufficient for casual TV viewing or watching movies and TV shows. It runs Fire OS, and comes with a remote that allows you to summon Amazon Alexa with the push of a button for a query or command. You can step up to a\n55-inch model\nfor $359.99 ($100 off) if you like its modest feature set but want a slightly larger screen.\nAmazon Fire TV 4-Series\n$\n290\n$\n400\n28\n% off\n$\n290\n$290 at Amazon (50-Inch)\n$360 at Amazon (55-Inch)\nHisense QD7\nIf your budget is under $500, the 55-inch\nHisense QD7\nhas a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for an all-time low of around $357.99 ($132 off) at\nAmazon\nand\nBest Buy\n. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (\nthis video\nfrom LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for around $467.99 ($132 off) at\nAmazon\nand\nBest Buy\n.\nHisense QD7\n$\n358\n$\n500\n28\n% off\n$\n358\n$358 at Amazon (55-Inch)\n$360 at Best Buy (55-Inch)\n$468 at Amazon (65-Inch)\nThe best deals on high-end 4K TVs\nSony Bravia 8 II OLED\nIf you want a TV that produces reference-quality images,\nSony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2)\nis the best choice. It was recently\nselected as the top TV\nin Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor. Disclosure:\nVerge\neditor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges. The 55-inch model also recently received a substantial price cut, dropping it to $2,198.99 ($801 off) at\nAmazon\n.\nSony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. Sony calls the Bravia 8 II its brightest OLED screen yet, and testing\nconducted by\nHometheaterreview\nfound its maximum brightness was 1,880 nits when viewing HDR content. Its predecessor topped out at 1,300 nits HDR video, or roughly 44 percent dimmer.\nThe TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. The judges in the aforementioned TV Shootout chose Sony’s set as the best model for SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) processing, but third of four models compared for HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing. Any OLED TV can show true black, but judges agreed that the Bravia 8 II pulled ahead in grayscale and contrast when viewing SDR video.\nSony says its TV has modes calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services, too. Sony Picture Core is a streaming service that’s available on select Bravia TVs and Sony gaming consoles, and allows you to stream or download 4K movies at far higher bitrates than competing services. The Bravia 8 II comes with 10 credits, which you can use to download movies for offline viewing, and two years of unlimited streaming for films in its catalogue.\nIf you want this TV in a larger size,\nAmazon\nand\nB&H Photo\nare offering the 65-inch model for around $2,998 ($501 off).\nSony Bravia 8 II\n$\n2198\n$\n3000\n27\n% off\n$\n2198\n$2198 at Amazon (55-inch)\n$2300 at Best Buy (55-inch)\n$2998 at Amazon (65-inch)\nLG C4 OLED\nThe last-gen\nLG C4\nremains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for around $1,396.99 ($1,303 off) at\nAmazon\n,\nB&H Photo\n, and\nBest Buy\n. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by\nTom’s Guide\n.\nAdditionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,799.96 ($1,900 off) at\nBest Buy\nand\nAmazon\n.\nLG C4\n$\n1397\n$\n1597\n13\n% off\n$\n1397\n$1397 at B&H Photo (65-Inch)\n$1397 at Amazon (65-Inch)\n$1799 at Amazon (77-inch)\nSony A90K\nSony’s 42-inch A90K\nis a premium OLED TV that it claims is specially optimized with features for gaming on a PlayStation 5, but realistically, all of the TVs in this list work great with the PS5 — not to mention all other modern consoles. It’s currently on sale for around $1,198 ($102 off) at\nAmazon\n,\nB&H Photo\n, and\nBest Buy\n. The TV has a 120Hz panel, with two HDMI 2.0 ports and HDMI 2.1 ports.\nAbout the special PS5 features, if you connect the console to the A90K, the TV will automatically enable Auto HDR Tone Mapping for more accurate colors, along with an Auto Genre Picture Mode that will adjust its settings based on the game you’re playing. Sony’s Cognitive Processor XR automatically adjusts the TV’s contrast, brightness, and colors.\nThe A90K can access Sony Pictures Core, a movie streaming platform exclusive to higher-end Sony TVs that allows you to watch uncompressed 4K movies. Sony includes 10 credits to build your Sony Pictures Core library, plus 24 months of streaming access. The aforementioned library is more limited than other streaming services, but it’s the closest you’ll get to watching a 4K Blu-ray without having to pop in a disc. Sony also offers the A90K in a 48-inch size, and you can pick one up at\nAmazon\nand\nBest Buy\nfor around $1,298 ($102 off).\nSony A90K\n$\n1198\n$\n1298\n8\n% off\n$\n1198\n$1198 at Amazon (42-Inch)\n$1200 at Best Buy (42-Inch)\n$1298 at Amazon (48-Inch)\nSony A95L\nSony’s 55-inch\nA95L\nis a premium TV with features that should appeal to gamers and cinephiles alike, and you can get it for around $2,198 ($601 off) at\nAmazon\n,\nB&H Photo\n, and\nBest Buy\n. The TV has a 120Hz panel and two HDMI 2.1 ports (four HDMI ports total), so you can play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. Its two HDMI 2.0 ports are fine for last-gen consoles like the original\nNintendo Switch\n. If you connect a PS5, the TV will adjust its video settings based on the genre of game you’re playing, which is a nice touch, but games on that console will look incredible on any OLED set.\nSony’s Cognitive Processor XR powers the A95L, which enables better motion processing so sports and games look less blurry. It also claims to improve the contrast and colors compared to previous generation Sony TVs. It has a peak brightness of 1,300 nits according to lab tests by\nTom’s Guide\n, which is higher than most of the other OLED TVs we found on sale.\nThe A95L is a Bravia-series TV, which means it can access Sony’s Picture Core. This video on demand service has the highest-bitrate (aka video quality) of any streaming platform, which means what you watch will look closer to an uncompressed 4K Blu-ray than a 4K stream from Netflix. Its library is limited, but Sony includes 10 credits with A95L, so you can download movies to keep forever, and a 24-month subscription that lets you stream videos from the library.\nIf you want a higher-end OLED TV, Sony’s A95L is a great choice and has features you won’t find on non-Sony TVs. You can also get the 65-inch model on sale for around $2,898 ($601 off) at\nAmazon\n,\nBest Buy\n, and\nB&H Photo\n.\nSony A95L\n$\n2198\n$\n2799\n21\n% off\n$\n2198\n$2198 at Amazon (55-Inch)\n$2898 at Amazon (65-Inch)\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nUpdate, September 3rd:\nUpdated pricing / availability and added newer deals for Samsung’s Q8F and Hisense’s U65QF.\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nBrandt Ranj\nClose\nBrandt Ranj\nCommerce Writer\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nBrandt Ranj\nDeals\nClose\nDeals\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nDeals\nEntertainment\nClose\nEntertainment\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nEntertainment\nGadgets\nClose\nGadgets\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGadgets\nGaming\nClose\nGaming\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGaming\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nTVs\nClose\nTVs\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTVs\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nAmazon ends shared Prime free shipping outside your home\nRemarkable’s new digital notepad is smaller than a paperback\nTesla’s new ‘Master Plan’ sounds like AI slop\nInstagram is coming to iPad, 15 years later\nGoogle gets to keep Chrome, judge rules in search antitrust case\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

While those leading the US healthcare system have embraced\nconspiracy theories\nand\njunk science\nto justify a reduced focus on vaccines (particularly the COVID jab) many people are still seeking out immunization. Google Maps isn't a good way to find it, though. In recent days, almost all search results for COVID vaccines have vanished from Google Maps.\nIn both the mobile app and website, Google Maps returns zero results for terms like \"COVID vaccine\" and simply \"vaccines.\" We've tested and confirmed this in multiple US regions, as well as internationally. In some places, these searches will return no local results but may include links to facilities hundreds of miles away. Meanwhile, searches for less-contentious injections like \"flu vaccine\" and \"shingles vaccine\" continue to get local results.\nThe\nFood and Drug Administration\nunder Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently approved the\nupdated COVID shot\n, but the agency only recommends it for those with underlying health conditions and people over age 65. That makes boosters harder for many Americans to get—and the first step is often finding a nearby provider of immunization. For at least the last week, Google Maps has returned no results for those vaccine-related queries.\nResults for the flu vaccine appear in Maps, but not COVID. The only working COVID results are hundreds of miles away.\nCredit:\n                                      Ryan Whitwam\nResults for the flu vaccine appear in Maps, but not COVID.

Google has yet to respond to further questions on the nature of the apparent glitch, which has wiped out COVID vaccine information in Maps while continuing to return results for other medical services and immunizations.\nThe sudden eroding federal support for routing vaccinations lurks in the background with this bizarre issue. When the Trump administration decided to rename the Gulf of Mexico, Google was widely hectored for\nits decision to quickly show\n\"Gulf of America\" on its maps, aligning with the Trump administration's preferred nomenclature. With the ramping up of anti-vaccine actions at the federal level, it is tempting to see a similar, nefarious purpose behind these disappearing results.\nAt present, we have no evidence that the change in Google's search results was intentional or targeted specifically at COVID immunization—indeed, making that change in such a ham-fisted way would be inadvisable. It does seem like an ill-timed and unusually specific \"technical issue,\" though. If Google provides further details on the missing search results, we'll post an update.\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

While those leading the US healthcare system have embraced\nconspiracy theories\nand\njunk science\nto justify a reduced focus on vaccines (particularly the COVID jab) many people are still seeking out immunization. Google Maps isn't a good way to find it, though. In recent days, almost all search results for COVID vaccines have vanished from Google Maps. In both the mobile app and website, Google Maps returns zero results for terms like \"COVID vaccine\" and simply \"vaccines.\" We've tested and confirmed this in multiple US regions, as well as internationally. In some places, these searches will return no local results but may include links to facilities hundreds of miles away. Meanwhile, searches for less-contentious injections like \"flu vaccine\" and \"shingles vaccine\" continue to get local results. The\nFood and Drug Administration\nunder Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently approved the\nupdated COVID shot\n, but the agency only recommends it for those with underlying health conditions and people over age 65. That makes boosters harder for many Americans to get—and the first step is often finding a nearby provider of immunization. For at least the last week, Google Maps has returned no results for those vaccine-related queries. Results for the flu vaccine appear in Maps, but not COVID.",

Samsung’s ultra-slim Android phone features the same 6.7-inch OLED display as the Galaxy S25 Plus, but the device’s 5.8mm thick design makes it feel completely different. Right now, you can grab the S25 Edge with 256GB of storage in\nblack\n,\nsilver\n, or\nblue\nfor an all-time low price of $699.99 ($400 off) at Amazon.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge\n$\n700\n$\n1100\n36\n% off\n$\n700\n$700 at Amazon (256GB)\n$850 at Best Buy (256GB)\n$1100 at Samsung (256GB)\nThe S25 Edge is a big phone, but its slimmer, more lightweight design means you can actually slide it into your pocket or evening bag without it protruding out. In fact, when\nThe Verge’s\nAllison Johnson\nreviewed the device\n, she encountered multiple instances where she thought she had left the phone behind, despite it sitting in her pocket.\nNow, I know what you’re thinking: Surely the thinner design equals terrible battery life. Thankfully, that’s not the case. The Galaxy S25 Edge’s battery life doesn’t stretch as far as what you’ll get with the S25 Plus or Ultra, especially if you do a lot of mobile gaming, but it’ll still last you a full day of texting, email, web browsing, streaming music, and more.\nRelated\nThe best Android phones\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a big phone with small phone energy\nThe bigger tradeoff might be in the camera department. The S25 Edge comes with only two rear cameras — a 200-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera. If a telephoto camera is a big deal to you, then you may want to skip this device. Otherwise, the S25 Edge can keep up with the other devices in the S25 lineup, with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, IP68 dust and water resistance, and an OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.\nRead our Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review\n.\nOther deals to check out\n8BitDo’s Pro 3\nwireless controller is currently available in classic Nintendo-inspired colors like\npurple\n,\ngray\n, and\nlight gray\nfor $62.99 ($7 off) at Amazon after clipping the on-page coupon. The Pro 3 features swappable ABXY face buttons and joystick caps, providing players with a highly customizable experience. It also features new L4 and R4 macro buttons between the triggers and its USB-C charging port, plus more durable and power efficient TMR joysticks. The controller works with a ton of platforms via Bluetooth, including the Steam Deck, Windows PC, Mac OS, Android, Apple TV, and the latest Nintendo Switch 2.\nRead our review\n.\nIf you own a MacBook Air or slim Windows laptop, chances are you don’t have enough ports to connect your peripherals. A USB-C hub can help, and the\nAnker 7-in-1 USB-C Hub\nis on sale for $19.99 ($6 off) at\nAmazon\n, matching its all-time low price. The hub provides you with seven ports, greatly expanding your machine’s capabilities.

The 1,215-piece set offers a pixelated recreation of a yellow-caped Mario riding Yoshi right out of the 16-bit Super Nintendo classic.

The new system includes three levels of service, the cheapest offering basic VPN service and the others adding extra features. Each one of those levels — Basic, Advanced and Pro — can be purchased for monthly, yearly or two-year durations.\nIn total, you've now got nine different options for subscribing to ExpressVPN. The company also says legacy plans will remain active \"for now,\" and current customers won't be downgraded. The change is similar to the approach already used by rivals like\nNordVPN\nand\nSurfshark\n.\nPreviously, ExpressVPN locked feature offerings to the duration of the plan, so the only way to get the full suite of features was to subscribe for 24 months. Now, while longer-term subscriptions will still offer discounts, features depend on your level of subscription instead of how long it lasts.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe new tiers roll in some features that were previously part of ExpressVPN's Identity Defender suite, including identity monitoring, credit reports and data removal services. New types of plans will also bump the number of allowed simultaneous connections to as high as 14. Here's what you'll get with each tier.\nExpressVPN\nThe Basic plan comes with \"core VPN functionality,\" which includes the Lightway protocol, the Network Lock kill switch and split tunneling on Windows, Android and macOS 10 and below. Basic users will also have access to the blockers for ads and malicious sites, though not the tracker blocker or parental controls. A Basic subscription can be used on 10 devices at once and will cost $12.99 for a month, $74.85 for a year and $97.72 for two years.\nThe Advanced plan raises the device limit to 12 and adds the blockers and parental controls, plus the ExpressVPN Keys password manager. It also gives you three days of eSIM service and adds the Identity Defender features — leak alerts, $1 million of identity theft insurance, data removal and credit monitoring. As was already the case, those ID protection features are available only to users in the United States.\nAn Advanced plan will cost $13.99 for a month, $89.85 for a year and $125.72 for two years. The one-year and two-year plans are both cheaper than the same duration used to cost. Advanced subscribers also get five days of eSIM service and a discount coupon for between 25 and 50 percent off an ExpressVPN Aircove router (it's not currently clear how the exact discount will be determined).\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAlthough Basic and Advanced users can pay extra (between $3.99 and $8.99) for a dedicated IP address, it comes standard on a Pro subscription. Pro users additionally get monthly credit reports and data removal, 14 simultaneous connections and an Aircove discount between 50 and 75 percent. A Pro plan costs $19.99 for a month, $134.95 for a year and $209.72 for two years.\nWhat ExpressVPN tiered pricing means for VPN shoppers\nUltimately, I don't think this new approach will change much about the experience of using ExpressVPN. It's not introducing any new features; I already touched on everything here in my recent\nExpressVPN review\n, so the only difference is how much you'll pay to access the perks.\nThe best news for consumers is that ExpressVPN is now available for significantly cheaper than before. A two-year Basic plan costs about 30 percent less than a two-year subscription used to — though a one-year basic plan is still more expensive than a comparable subscription to\nProton VPN\nor Surfshark. I'm happy to say a Basic subscription is about as strong as ExpressVPN has always been, only missing a few peripheral features.\nWe've recently overhauled our ranking of the\nbest VPNs\n, including the new information from ExpressVPN — check out the full list in the link.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nUpdate, September 2025, 4PM ET:\nThis story has been updated to add a statement from an ExpressVPN representative on the features of the Basic plan.\nExpressVPN\nFrom $3.49/month at ExpressVPN\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",

    "topic": "Personalized AI companion app Dot is shutting down",
    "source": "Dot, an\nAI companion app that aimed\nto be a friend and confidante, is shutting down, the company\nannounced\non Friday. On a message published on its website, the startup behind Dot, New Computer, said that the product will remain operational until October 5, giving users time to download their data.\nLaunched in 2024 by co-founders Sam Whitmore and former Apple designer Jason Yuan, Dot waded into what’s now become a more controversial area for AI chatbots. The app they created was described as an AI “friend and companion,” which would become more personalized to you and your interests over time in order to offer advice, sympathy, and emotional support.\nAs Yuan explained at the time, Dot was “facilitating a relationship with my inner self. It’s like a living mirror of myself, so to speak,” he said.\nHowever, this may not be a safe area to invest in as a smaller startup.\nAs AI technology has become more mainstream, there have been reports of how emotionally vulnerable people have been led into\ndelusional\nthinking by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. This has led to a phenomenon\ndescribed\nas “AI psychosis,” resulting from how the scyophantic chatbots reinforce a user’s confused or paranoid beliefs.\nAs Dot shuts down, AI chatbot apps broadly have been falling under increased scrutiny over safety concerns. OpenAI is\ncurrently being sued\nby the parents of a California teenager who took his life after messaging with ChatGPT about his suicidal thoughts. Other\nstories\nhave highlighted how AI companion apps can reinforce unhealthy behaviors in users who are mentally unwell. This week, two U.S. attorneys general\nsent a letter to OpenAI\nover safety concerns.\nDot’s makers didn’t address whether these types of issues had weighed on the founders’ minds. Instead, the brief post only notes that Whitmore and Yuan’s shared “Northstar” had diverged.\n“Rather than compromise either vision, we’ve decided to go our separate ways and wind down operations,” the post explains.\n“We want to be sensitive to the fact that this means many of you will lose access to a friend, confidante, and companion, which is somewhat unprecedented in software, so we want to give you some time to say goodbye. Dot will remain operational until October 5, and until then you can download all of your data by navigating to the settings page and tapping ‘Request your data.’”\nThe post suggests the startup had “hundreds of thousands” of users, but data from app intelligence provider\nAppfigures\nsees only 24,500 lifetime downloads on iOS since launching in June 2024.

    "summary": "Dot, an\nAI companion app that aimed\nto be a friend and confidante, is shutting down, the company\nannounced\non Friday. On a message published on its website, the startup behind Dot, New Computer, said that the product will remain operational until October 5, giving users time to download their data. Launched in 2024 by co-founders Sam Whitmore and former Apple designer Jason Yuan, Dot waded into what’s now become a more controversial area for AI chatbots. The app they created was described as an AI “friend and companion,” which would become more personalized to you and your interests over time in order to offer advice, sympathy, and emotional support. As Yuan explained at the time, Dot was “facilitating a relationship with my inner self. It’s like a living mirror of myself, so to speak,” he said. However, this may not be a safe area to invest in as a smaller startup. As AI technology has become more mainstream, there have been reports of how emotionally vulnerable people have been led into\ndelusional\nthinking by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. This has led to a phenomenon\ndescribed\nas “AI psychosis,” resulting from how the scyophantic chatbots reinforce a user’s confused or paranoid beliefs. As Dot shuts down, AI chatbot apps broadly have been falling under increased scrutiny over safety concerns. OpenAI is\ncurrently being sued\nby the parents of a California teenager who took his life after messaging with ChatGPT about his suicidal thoughts. Other\nstories\nhave highlighted how AI companion apps can reinforce unhealthy behaviors in users who are mentally unwell. This week, two U.S. attorneys general\nsent a letter to OpenAI\nover safety concerns. Dot’s makers didn’t address whether these types of issues had weighed on the founders’ minds. Instead, the brief post only notes that Whitmore and Yuan’s shared “Northstar” had diverged. “Rather than compromise either vision, we’ve decided to go our separate ways and wind down operations,” the post explains.",

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.\nShowrunner — the startup that wants to “revolutionize” the entertainment industry by\ncharging people to prompt up AI-generated videos featuring copyrighted IP\n— is working on a new project to restore an Orson Welles classic.\nOn Friday, Showrunner announced that it has designed a new generative AI model that is meant to help recreate lost footage from\nThe Magnificent Ambersons\n, Welles’ 1942 adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s 1918 novel about a family whose vast fortune is being decimated by tech-driven industrialization. Though Welles initially crafted a version of the film whose runtime clocked in at 131 minutes, RKO — one of the project’s production companies —\ncut it down to 88 minutes\nwithout the director’s input after he lost control of the editing process.\nThe studio’s cut went on to be nominated for four Oscars and is broadly considered to be one of Welles’ best works. Welles, whom\nRKO accused of being difficult to work with\n, disowned the studio’s version of the film. He\nreportedly later said\nthat “they destroyed\nAmbersons\nand it destroyed me.”\nBut Showrunner believes that, by using generative AI, it can bring back the lost footage and give people a chance to see\nThe Magnificent Ambersons\nas Welles originally intended. In a\nstatement to\nThe Hollywood Reporter\nabout the new project, Showrunner co-founder Edward Saatchi admitted that while generative AI as it currently exists “can’t sustain a story beyond one short episode,” he is confident that “the technology is getting closer to prompting entire films with AI.”\nRelated\nShowrunner wants to turn you into a happy little content prompter for the ‘Netflix of AI’\nWhile Welles wrote detailed notes about how he wanted\nThe Magnificent Amersons\nto be cut, RKO did not follow them and the studio ultimately destroyed the negatives correlating to the film’s lost footage for storage reasons. Showrunner intends to work around those hurdles with a mix of AI-generated approximations of what Welles might have shot and sequences featuring live actors whose faces are manipulated with gen AI to look like members of the original film’s cast. According to IndieWire, Showrunner’s FILM-1 model will be used to generate keyframes for the missing footage, and set photos will be used to create the “spatial setting.”\nTo help realize the project, Showrunner has brought on Tom Clive, an AI VFX artist who specializes in face-swapping and previously worked on\nAlien: Romulus\nand\nHere\nwhile at\nMetaphysic\nShowrunner is also working with filmmaker Brian Rose, who previously\nattempted his own\nAmbersons\nrestoration\nwith hand drawn animation based on the 1942 film’s shooting script and archival photographs from the original production.\nSpeaking to\nNPR in 2023\n, Rose said that populating his recreated scenes with characters was one of the endeavor’s more challenging aspects. Rose also noted that, because Warner Bros. Discovery holds the intellectual property rights to Welles’\nThe Magnificent Amberson\n’s, there was some uncertainty about whether he could legally release the project, and “the thought was to beg forgiveness later.”\nShowrunner is no stranger to going the “just do it and worry about the consequences later” route. The startup previously made headlines for releasing unauthorized episodes of\nSouth Park\nthat were created with its in-house generative AI models. The company seems to be trying to get ahead of any legal trouble by choosing not to monetize its\nAmbersons\nproject.\nSaatchi told\nTHR\nthat the goal here isn’t to make money off of the lost minutes of footage, but rather to “see them exist in the world after 80 years of people asking ‘might this have been the best film ever made in its original form.’” He also said that Showrunner will gladly give its creation to the IP holders if they “see a marketplace for it and a path for it outside of an academic context.”\nThis is exactly the sort of thing you’d expect to hear from an AI-focused founder on a mission to legitimize their business and\nsecure deals with bigger players in the entertainment game\n.\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nClose\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nFilm & TV Reporter\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nAI\nClose\nAI\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAI\nEntertainment\nClose\nEntertainment\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nEntertainment\nFilm\nClose\nFilm\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nFilm\nNews\nClose\nNews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nNews\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nMicrosoft is about to shake up its Copilot pricing for businesses\nHow Wikipedia survives while the rest of the internet breaks\nThe Browser Company, maker of Arc and Dia, is being acquired\nAnnual Paramount Plus subscriptions are half off until September 18th\nHere is Lego’s $1,000 Death Star, the most expensive Lego set ever\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

Typically, screen reading software is custom-built for each game, which can make them resource-intensive for developers to implement. \"Building something like that from scratch has to be decided upon early in development so you have the time/resources allocated to make it properly,\" Steve Saylor, an accessibility consultant and creator,\nshared on Bluesky\n. \"Having it in-engine can mean the heavy lifting is done for you, and the cost of time/resources now is significantly lower.\"\nUnity previously offered APIs for both Android and iOS' built-in screen readers in its Unity 6.0 release, but hadn't yet added support for Windows Narrator or macOS VoiceOver. With this new alpha and its eventual release as Unity 6.3, developers creating games with Unity will have access to a native screen reader in all of the engine's major platforms.

Ian Carlos Campbell\nContributing Reporter\nFri, September 5, 2025 at 8:03 PM UTC\n1 min read\nUnity\nUnity is\nupdating its game engine\nto support native screen readers in both macOS and Windows. The feature is available now in the Unity 6000.3.0a5 alpha, and should make the process of making games accessible for blind players cheaper for developers,\nCan I Play That? writes\n. Screen readers narrate on-screen menus so blind and low-vision players can navigate a game or a piece of software without additional assistance. Typically, screen reading software is custom-built for each game, which can make them resource-intensive for developers to implement. \"Building something like that from scratch has to be decided upon early in development so you have the time/resources allocated to make it properly,\" Steve Saylor, an accessibility consultant and creator,\nshared on Bluesky\n. \"Having it in-engine can mean the heavy lifting is done for you, and the cost of time/resources now is significantly lower.\"\nUnity previously offered APIs for both Android and iOS' built-in screen readers in its Unity 6.0 release, but hadn't yet added support for Windows Narrator or macOS VoiceOver. With this new alpha and its eventual release as Unity 6.3, developers creating games with Unity will have access to a native screen reader in all of the engine's major platforms. Considering how popular Unity is as a game engine, that could vastly improve the accessibility of future games. Advertisement\nAbout our ads",

Bush administration, when NASA decided to put a satellite into orbit to track emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas pumped into the atmosphere through human activity.\nAfter many twists and turns, NASA's 23-year remit of charting greenhouse gas emissions could come to a close as soon as the end of this month. President Donald Trump's\nbudget request to Congress\ncalls for terminating 41 of NASA's 124 science missions in development or operations, and another 17 would see their funding zeroed out in the near future. Overall, the proposed budget slashes NASA's spending by 25 percent and cuts NASA's science funding in half.\nThis year's federal budget runs out September 30, and although lawmakers from both parties have\nsignaled they will reject most of Trump's cuts\n, it's far from certain that Congress will pass a budget for the next fiscal year before the looming deadline. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has directed NASA managers to make plans to close out the missions tagged for cancellation.\nWithout specific congressional direction, the White House would have a clear hand at implementing Trump's wishes. But even with a full appropriations bill, Trump's budget director, Russ Vought, could try to circumvent congressional will with so-called pocket rescissions. The White House is currently\nlocked in a court battle over the legality of this practice\n, where the administration could refuse to spend money approved by Congress.\nThis all leaves NASA officials and scientists in a lurch. Two of the missions with uncertain futures monitor carbon dioxide levels in the Earth's atmosphere. US taxpayers paid more than $750 million to design, build, and launch the instruments, and killing the missions now would save roughly $16 million per year.\nDollars for pennies\nDavid Crisp was one of NASA's leading atmospheric scientists until his retirement from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2022. He\ntold The New York Times\nthat shutting down the agency's two operating Orbiting Carbon Observatory missions would be like buying a car \"and then running it into a tree after a few years, just to save the price of a tank of gas.\"\n\"We built these satellites and got them approved and got taxpayer dollars to build them because they serve critical functions in commerce, in national security, in food security, in water security,\" Crisp told the Times.\nCrisp first presented the idea for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) at the turn of the century. NASA selected the proposal from a list of 18 mission concepts in 2002. The OCO mission enjoyed a relatively smooth ride through development, avoiding significant technical issues and remaining above the partisan hubbub in Washington, DC.\nBut all of that changed when the satellite launched in February 2009. A few minutes after liftoff, a protective shroud surrounding the OCO satellite clung to the rocket when it should have jettisoned. The mission was doomed, and the satellite crashed back to Earth. Within days, scientists began lobbying for a replacement. OCO's mission was to create the first global maps of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide, places where the gas is emitted into the atmosphere and absorbed back into oceans and plants.\nArtist's illustration of the OCO-3 instrument and its operating post on the International Space Station.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          NASA/JPL-Caltech/David Hinkle\nThese measurements are fundamental to understanding how greenhouse gas emissions relate to rising temperatures, simultaneously contributing to scientific research and informing policymakers of compliance with environmental regulations.\nNASA leadership took the rare step of approving a carbon copy of OCO less than a year after the 2009 launch failure. That's when the mission became a political football.\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives\nsingled out the replacement mission\n, named OCO-2, for cancellation in 2011 as a target for deficit reduction. OCO-2 survived and made it to the launch pad in 2014. This time, the free-flying satellite rocketed into orbit with no issues and continues operating today.\nAmplifying returns\nOCO-2's measurements paint a complex picture. It's taken some time for scientists to learn how to interpret the data by separating out natural sources of natural carbon dioxide emissions from those caused by human activity. Similarly, OCO-2 has monitored locations where carbon is absorbed from the atmosphere, primarily tropical and boreal forests and oceans, along with artificial carbon capture installations.\nThe year after OCO-2's launch, NASA started planning to place a similar instrument on the outside of the International Space Station. The purpose of this follow-on mission, called OCO-3, was twofold: monitor carbon emissions at city scales with greater precision, and track changes in atmospheric concentrations of carbon throughout the course of a day.\nTrump's first administration sought to cancel OCO-3 in 2017 and 2018. Lawmakers restored funding for OCO-3, and the instrument launched in 2019 in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule.\nThis snapshot of carbon dioxide concentrations over Los Angeles on February 19, 2021, was captured by NASA's OCO-3 instrument mounted on the International Space Station.\nThe OCO-2 and OCO-3 instruments observe the atmosphere from different vantage points in space. Scientists have combined data from both missions to pinpoint local sources of carbon dioxide, improving on the regional maps scientists proposed to produce with the original OCO mission.\nThese improved results have come out in the last few years. A\nstudy released in 2023\nused OCO-2 and OCO-3 measurements to quantify the carbon dioxide discharged from a power station in Poland, the largest single emitter in Europe. A\nseparate paper published earlier this year\nin Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres showed how scientists pinned down carbon emissions coming from even smaller point sources, such as a coal-fired power plant in Montana and oil sand processing facilities in Canada.\nNASA's carbon-monitoring missions were never designed to detect carbon sources with such precision. \"As a community we are refining the tools and techniques to be able to extract more information from the data than what we had originally planned,\" said Abhishek Chatterjee, OCO-3's project scientist at JPL, in a 2023 press release. \"We are learning that we can actually understand a lot more about anthropogenic emissions than what we had previously expected.\"\nAnother unexpected bonus from the OCO missions, according to JPL, has been their ability to track growing seasons and crops by measuring the planet's photosynthesis.\nBefore satellite measurements, researchers relied on estimates and data from a smattering of air and ground-based sensors. An\ninstrument on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, with the longest record of direct carbon dioxide measurements\n, is also slated for shutdown under Trump's budget.\nIt requires a sustained, consistent dataset to recognize trends. That's why, for example, the US government has funded a series of Landsat satellites since 1972 to create an uninterrupted data catalog illustrating changes in global land use.\nBut NASA is now poised to shut off OCO-2 and OCO-3 instead of thinking about how to replace them when they inevitably cease working. The missions are now operating beyond their original design lives, but scientists say both instruments are in good health.\nCan anyone replace NASA?\nResearch institutes in Japan, China, and Europe have launched their own greenhouse gas-monitoring satellites. So far, all of them lack the spatial resolution of the OCO instruments, meaning they can't identify emission sources with the same precision as the US missions. A new European mission called CO2M will come closest to replicating OCO-2 and OCO-3, but it won't launch until 2027.\nSeveral private groups have launched their own satellites to measure atmospheric chemicals, but these have primarily focused on\ndetecting localized methane emissions\nfor regulatory purposes, and not on global trends.\nOne of the newer groups in this sector, known as the Carbon Mapper Coalition, launched its first small satellite last year. This nonprofit consortium includes contributors from JPL, the same lab that spawned the OCO instruments, as well as Planet Labs, the California Air Resources Board, universities, and private investment funds.\nGovernment leaders in Montgomery County, Maryland, have set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2027, and 100 percent by 2035. Mark Elrich, the Democratic county executive, said the pending termination of NASA's carbon-monitoring missions \"weakens our ability to hold polluters accountable.\"\n\"This decision would ... wipe out years of research that helps us understand greenhouse gas emissions, plant health, and the forces that are driving climate change,\" Elrich said in a press conference last month.\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

Scion turns biofeedback, whether that’s from houseplants or your own skin, into CV (control voltage) for controlling other synth modules in a larger setup. Touching two sensors to your hand or a mushroom completes a circuit, and then electrical fluctuations in that circuit can be used to trigger different notes, or change the cutoff on a filter, for instance.\nA little over a year ago, he approached Instruo about building something new. The fruit of that collaboration is the Pocket Scion, an affordable self-contained instrument that can turn small electrical changes from living organisms into MIDI data and create soundscapes using one of the four built-in sound engines.\nThe Pocket Scion has a number of advanced capabilities too, including MIDI out for controlling external instruments. There’s also a companion app for Windows, macOS, and Linux that exposes sound design tools for creating your own synth patches, and can send data over Open Sound Control (OSC), which gives it control over a ton of audio and video programs like Max/MSP, Pure Data, and Unreal Engine for creating visualization or complex reactive art installations. It’s more powerful than you’d expect given its $149 price.\nThe initial run of Pocket Scions sold out almost immediately. But you can place a preorder for when the next batch ships “early next week,” according to retailer Control Voltage.\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nTerrence O'Brien\nClose\nTerrence O'Brien\nWeekend Editor\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nTerrence O'Brien\nEntertainment\nClose\nEntertainment\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nEntertainment\nMusic\nClose\nMusic\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nMusic\nNews\nClose\nNews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nNews\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nGoogle leaks its own new Nest Cams and Doorbell\nAnnual Paramount Plus subscriptions are half off until September 18th\nHere is Lego’s $1,000 Death Star, the most expensive Lego set ever\nGoogle Photos now lets you animate your camera roll with Veo 3 for free\nOnePlus and Hasselblad are parting ways\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

It's the most powerful 911 to date, excluding some limited-run models, and may well be the quickest to 60 mph from a standing start, dispatching that dash in just 2.4 seconds. And it's all thanks to one of the most interesting hybrid powertrains on sale today.\nRather than just bolting an electric motor to an existing 911, Porsche designed an entirely new 3.6 L flat-six engine, taking the opportunity to ditch the belt drive and move some of the ancillaries, which can instead be powered by the car's 400 V traction battery.\nThe system debuted in the 911 GTS T-Hybrid,\nwhich Ars recently reviewed\n. For that car, Porsche added a single electric turbocharger, which works like the MGU-H in a Formula 1 car. It spins up almost instantly to 120,000 rpm to eliminate throttle lag, but also recaptures excess energy from the spinning turbine and sends that to the 1.9 kWh battery pack.\nThe result is a turbocharged engine that has a remarkable throttle response that's more like an EV, with no perceptible lag between initial tip-in and power being delivered to the wheels.\nFor the 2026 911 Turbo S, there are a pair of these electric turbochargers. And like the GTS, you'll find a 53 hp (40 kW), 110 lb-ft (150 Nm) permanent synchronous motor inside the eight-speed dual clutch transmission. Total output is a heady 701 hp (523 kW) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm), which is sufficient to cut the 0–60 mph (0–98 km/h) time to 2.4 seconds. 124 mph (200 km/h) takes just 8.4 seconds, half a second less than the 2025 Turbo S.\nAnd despite weighing an extra 180 lbs (82 kg), the new Turbo S is significantly faster around the 12.9-mile (20.8 km)\nNürburgring Nordschliefe\nthan the non-hybrid Turbo S. Last fall in testing, a hybrid 911 Turbo S driven by Jörg Bergmeister lapped the 'ring in 7 minutes, 3.92 seconds—14 seconds faster than the old car.\n\"You don't feel the weight gain. On the contrary—the car is much more agile, has more grip and is significantly faster than its predecessor in all relevant sections of the track,\" Bergmeister said.\nThe 400 V hybrid system also means Porsche could fit a new electrohydraulic antiroll bars, which respond much more quickly than the hydraulic setup in non-hybrid 911s.\nWith this car you don't need to wait for the turbos anymore.\nPorsche\nWith this car you don't need to wait for the turbos anymore.\nPorsche\nYou don't have to order a Porsche Cabriolet with red leather, it just seems like that.\nPorsche\nYou don't have to order a Porsche Cabriolet with red leather, it just seems like that.\nPorsche\nUnfortunately the hybrid system means there's no manual transmission option.\nPorsche\nUnfortunately the hybrid system means there's no manual transmission option.\nPorsche\nYou don't have to order a Porsche Cabriolet with red leather, it just seems like that.\nPorsche\nUnfortunately the hybrid system means there's no manual transmission option.\nPorsche\n\"Turbonite\" accents let you know this is a 911 Turbo.\nPorsche\nA cutaway illustration of the 911 Turbo S.\nPorsche\nA cutaway illustration of the 911 Turbo S's electrohydraulic chassis control system\nPorsche\nA cutaway illustration of the 911 Turbo S's dual clutch transmission and electric traction motor.\nPorsche\nA cutaway illustration of the 911 Turbo S electric turbocharger.\nPorsche\nThe 3.6 L Porsche T-Hybrid engine.\nPorsche\n\"The 911 Turbo S is the most complete and versatile way to drive a Porsche 911.

Until Congress votes on the issue, the name change is effectively a rebrand of the DoD that could be reversed with the signature of a future president.\nBut there was another potential name change revealed by the Pentagon on Friday, just hours before Trump signed the War Department order. This one may have more staying power.\nThe news first appeared in a standard announcement of promotions and new assignments for 17 general and flag officers. One of the reassignments was for Maj. Gen. Gregory Gagnon, who was nominated for promotion to become a three-star lieutenant-general as head of \"US Space Force Combat Forces Command\" at Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado.\nThere's no such command within the military's byzantine organizational structure, so Ars asked the Space Force about the name. It turns out the Space Force is considering renaming one of its existing field commands as Combat Forces Command. This existing post is currently known as Space Operations Command, and it works\nwith US Space Command\nto provide personnel (on the ground) and assets (on the ground and in orbit), and intelligence to support ongoing military space operations.\nNames don't win wars, but a Space Force spokesperson said the proposed new name \"better reflects the field command’s critical responsibility as the Space Force’s proponent for combat space power, including generating and improving combat-ready forces to execute\" missions assigned by the Space Force and Space Command.\nIncreasingly, the focus of US military space operations is shifting from an approach of controlling satellites and tracking other objects in space\ntoward a more adversarial posture\n. Today, the US military is monitoring the maneuvers of more than 1,000 Chinese satellites in orbit, including missions capable of disabling US satellites,\nrefueling critical Chinese military spacecraf\nt, and\nguiding terrestrial weapons toward their targets\n.\nIn recent years, Space Force officials have talked more openly about not just defending US satellites in orbit, but developing offensive\ncapabilities to disable or destroy spacecraft operated by an adversary\n. The proposed\nGolden Dome missile defense shield\nwould include space-based interceptors, bringing yet another element of combat into orbit.\nA Space Force spokesperson said Space Operations Command would be designated Combat Forces Command \"upon the establishment of a new commander, which is currently pending formal approval and confirmation\" by the Senate.\nAn infographic explaining the capabilities of Space Operations Command.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          US Space Force/Robert Buckingham and Dave Grim\nThe incoming commander, Lt. Gen. Gagnon, has served as the Space Force's chief intelligence officer at the Pentagon since 2022. If confirmed, Gagnon would replace Lt. Gen. David \"Rock\" Miller, who took command of Space Operations Command nearly two years ago. Miller's next assignment will be at the Pentagon, where he will serve as the Space Force's chief of strategy.\nSpace Operations Command was established in 2020 as part of a military reorganization following the creation of the Space Force as the military's newest armed service branch. From the start, the cornerstone of the new command's mission was to \"prepare for war that either begins or extends into space,\" the first chief of the Space Force, retired Gen. John \"Jay\" Raymond, said at the time.\nWhen he took the top job at Space Operations Command early last year, Miller said his task was to \"build on but also build out [America's] combat space power.\"\nA Space Force spokesperson echoed these sentiments in a statement Friday.\nThe spokesperson said the command's mission \"is to generate, present, sustain, and improve combat-ready intelligence, cyber, and space forces, while partnering across the US government, allies, and commercial agencies to project combat power in, from, and to space.\"\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Trump's decision to bring back the Department of War name signaled a \"vibe shift\" to \"restore a warrior ethos\" among US military forces, repeating a familiar talking point since he took the top job at the Pentagon in January.\nWhile it's unclear how long the Department of War rebrand will last, the Space Force's Combat Forces Command might stick around.\nOfficials in the first Trump administration were among the first in government to describe space as a \"war-fighting domain\" akin to land, air, sea, and cyberspace. However, the language only escalated during the Biden administration, which also continued to boost the Space Force's budget.\nFrank Kendall, who served as secretary of the Air Force under Biden, said in January that space will be a \"decisive theater\" in modern warfare.\nAnd last year, several Space Force generals began talking openly about deploying offensive weapons in space, something that was anathema just a few years ago, at least for discussion in public forums. Gen. Chance Saltzman, the Space Force's top general, said last December the service's job was to provide the president with \"offensive and defense options\" for combat in space.\n\"In 2014, we had senior leaders start to talk about space and war in the same sentence,\" Saltzman said. \"They got kind of berated by the senior leadership. So this is still a relatively new condition when we’re talking about war-fighting in space.\"\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

The order approves the Pentagon's use of the Department of War name as an \"additional secondary title\" for the Department of Defense while the Trump administration seeks congressional approval to officially change the name. Until Congress votes on the issue, the name change is effectively a rebrand of the DoD that could be reversed with the signature of a future president. But there was another potential name change revealed by the Pentagon on Friday, just hours before Trump signed the War Department order. This one may have more staying power.

She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nRelated\nThe best phone to buy right now\nThe best Android phones\nThe best foldable phone you can buy\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat I’m looking for\nHow we test\nCollapse\nThere’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become\nso routine that it’s mostly painless\n.\nStrong software support\nCollapse\nAt least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There’s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches.\nA good screen\nCollapse\nSince you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone’s screen is one place you shouldn’t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today’s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens; however, for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn’t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate.\nServiceable storage space\nCollapse\nIf you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you’ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you’ll accumulate over the years. Ideally, you’ll get at least 128GB built in.\nOne good rear camera, not four mediocre ones\nCollapse\nUpgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array — those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\nIn this article\nThe best cheap iPhone\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe best cheap iPhone\n7\nVerge Score\niPhone 16E\n$\n599\n$\n599\nThe Good\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\nThe Bad\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n$599 at Apple\n$600 at Best Buy\n$600 at Verizon\nHow we rate and review products\nScreen:\n6.1-inch, 1170p OLED /\nProcessor:\nA18\nCameras:\n48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie /\nCharging:\n20W wired, 7.5W wireless /\nWeather-resistance rating:\nIP6\n8\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly\ncheap.\nIf you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nRelated\nThe iPhone 17’s potential makeover might be just enough\nApple could bring its ‘Pro’ OLED displays to the entire iPhone 17 line\nThe best iPhones in 2025\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nThe iPhone 16E features a single 48-megapixel camera.\nPhoto by Chris Welch / The Verge\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far\nis underwhelming\nand the most interesting bits\nwon’t arrive anytime soon\n. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now.

With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right.\nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nRelated\nThe Google Pixel 10 and 10 Pro come with magnets, a new chip, and AI everywhere\nThe best new features of the Pixel 10 lineup\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9.

It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best\nbig\nscreens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\nRead my full OnePlus 13R review.\nOther budget phones to consider\nThe\n2025 Motorola Moto G Power\noffers a lot despite its starting price of $299.99. It features a 6.8-inch LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, wireless charging support, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is increasingly rare in 2025. Additionally, the device combines both IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it’s rated for both submersion in water and exposure to high-pressure water jets and steam, in addition to full protection from dust.\nThe\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE\nis another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 9A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the\nnewer Galaxy S25\n.\nRead our review\n.\nThe\nSamsung Galaxy A56\nrecently launched in the US with a starting price of $499. The device has all the makings of a solid midrange phone, including a 6.7-inch OLED display, a 50-megapixel main camera, an Exynos 1580 chip, and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. Although we haven’t tested it yet, it has some pretty stiff competition in the form of the Pixel 9A, which also has a starting price of $499.\nWe got\nour first glimpse\nof the\nTCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G\nback at CES 2025. The device features an Nxtpaper matte LCD screen that’s supposed to be easier on your eyes than a traditional LCD, as it reduces your exposure to blue light. It also features a “Max Ink Mode,” which turns the screen monochrome and silences notifications. This, in turn, can help extend the phone’s battery life to multiple days.\nRead our initial impressions\n.\nThe\nSamsung Galaxy A36 5G\nis another great choice that recently launched in the US for $399.99. The device sports a big OLED display, a decent midrange Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 processor, and an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. Samsung is promising six years of OS and security updates, which is a lot in this price range. Compared to the Galaxy A35 5G, which we previously included in this guide but is no longer available, the A36 5G drops the microSD slot for a second SIM card slot. While we haven’t tested the A36 5G, its predecessor offered a good balance of hardware and price, and the latest release sounds just as compelling.\nUpdate, September 8th:\nUpdated pricing / availability.\nBrandon Russell also contributed to this post.\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nAllison Johnson\nClose\nAllison Johnson\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nAllison Johnson\nAndroid\nClose\nAndroid\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAndroid\nApple\nClose\nApple\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nApple\nBuying Guides\nClose\nBuying Guides\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nBuying Guides\nGoogle\nClose\nGoogle\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGoogle\niOS\nClose\niOS\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\niOS\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nGoogle finally details Gemini usage limits\nThe influencer in this Vodafone ad isn’t real\nThe iPhone 17’s potential makeover might be just enough\nGoogle admits the open web is in ‘rapid decline’\nOpenAI comes for Hollywood with Critterz, an AI-powered animated film\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

    "topic": "Apple’s creator-centric iPhone 17 Pro will make the vlogging camera obsolete",
    "source": "Apple\nunveiled its new line of iPhones\non Tuesday, and the\niPhone 17 Pro\nis making a direct appeal to content creators.\nThe iPhone camera has long checked all the boxes for anything that a casual user might need, making a digital camera obsolete for most consumers. But for millions of content creators — an industry encompassing an estimated\n200 million\npotential customers — it has remained necessary to buy handheld video cameras from companies like Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon, and Fujifilm. Some of these camera brands have spun up entire product lines marketed as “vlogging cameras,” featuring pop-out displays to record selfie videos, as well as compatibility with the common dimensions used for social media.\nBut the iPhone 17 Pro could finally be the device that makes content creators’ other video cameras collect dust.\nAt a glance, a key difference here is that the new iPhone 17 Pro’s camera sensor is 56% larger than the iPhone 16 Pro’s. The size of a camera sensor impacts most aspects of a camera’s performance, like low-light capabilities, depth of field, and resolution — so, basically, the specs are simply just better on the new device.\nBut under more scrutiny, the specs remain impressive for a pocketable camera that weighs half a pound. (It still clocks in a tad lighter than the Ricoh GR IIIx, a tiny camera I’ve been eyeing for everyday street photography.) The iPhone 17 Pro’s main, ultra wide, and telephoto lenses are all 48MP fusion cameras, making optical zoom possible at 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x, and 8x. The telephoto lens is a huge improvement from the iPhone 16 Pro’s 12 MP lens, while the selfie camera also improves from 12 MP to 18 MP.\n“The wider field of view in higher resolution are particularly useful when recording yourself speaking directly to the camera, making our Pro models the absolute best choice for content creators,” said Patrick Carroll, manager of iPhone camera architecture, during Apple’s presentation.\nBut most important for creators is the phone’s video capabilities — like the previous model, the iPhone 17 Pro supports 4K 120 fps video recording in Dolby Vision, but it’s the new, creator-focused video features that come baked into the phone that make it stand apart.\nThough also included in other iPhone 17 models, the dual front and back camera recording is bound to be a hit with creators. The whole product line also supports Center Stage mode on the front camera, which lets users capture both horizontal and vertical orientations without rotating the phone. These features will be better on the Pro, since it improves on the basic device’s video capabilities with ultra-stabilized video at 4k 60 fps, which is a boon for creators on the go.\nImage Credits:\nApple\nWhen it comes to editing and compatibility with professional film setups — something central to creators’ workflow — the iPhone 17 Pro takes a big leap.\nFor creators who record videos or livestream in a home studio, the iPhone 17 Pro supports Genlock — a setup that allows multiple cameras to easily work together in sync — with an API available for developers to create custom filming setups.\nIn conjunction with the release of these new iPhones is\nFinal Cut Camera 2.0\n, an upgrade to Apple’s free app that makes more professional-level video editing possible on the device. With the updated app, creators can film in Apple’s\nProRes RAW\nformat, which Apple says will speed up exports and make files smaller without sacrificing quality.\nFinal Cut Camera 2.0\nImage Credits:\nApple\n“The update also introduces open gate recording, which uses the full camera sensor to capture a wider field of view at resolutions greater than DCI 4K,” Apple said in a press release. “This gives editors ultimate flexibility to reframe shots, stabilize footage, and set final aspect ratios, all without compromising image quality or performance.”\nIt makes sense that iPhones have historically left a bit to be desired for professionals. The iPhone, unlike other cameras, has to do so much more than just take photos and video — Canon, for example, doesn’t have to dedicate any of its hardware budget to GPUs that run complex AI models on-device.\nBut the bottom line is, the iPhone 17 Pro is a phone. For many creators, carrying one device in an iPhone, as opposed to a phone and a separate camera, is already appealing enough.\nTopics\nApple\n,\nApple Event\n,\nHardware\n,\niPhone\n,\niPhone 17 Pro\n,\nSocial\nAmanda Silberling\nSenior Writer\nAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-42944, makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute commands by submitting malicious payloads to an open port.\nThe maximum-severity threat stems from a deserialization vulnerability. Serialization is a coding process that translates data structures and object states into formats that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. Deserialization is the process in reverse.\nIn Tuesday’s disclosure, SAP revealed three other high-severity NetWeaver vulnerabilities, with ratings of 9.9, 9.6, and 9.1.\nWord of the newly documented vulnerabilities comes five days after security firm SecurityBridge\nreported\nthat a separate high-severity vulnerability SAP patched last month was under active exploitation in the wild. That vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-42957 and carrying a severity rating of 9.9, resides in the SAP S/4HANA an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software suite developed for managing large organizations’ complex business processes, including those for finance, accounting, and HR.\nSecurityBridge warned that CVE-2025-42957 allowed hackers with minimal system rights to mount “a complete system compromise with minimal effort required, where successful exploitation can easily lead to fraud, data theft, espionage, or the installation of ransomware.”\nThe security firm went on to write:\nThe attacker needs only low-level credentials on the SAP system (any valid user account with permissions to call the vulnerable RFC module and the specific S_DMIS authorization with activity 02), and no user interaction is required.\nThe attack complexity is low and can be performed over the network, which is why the CVSS score is so high (9.9). In summary, a malicious insider or a threat actor who has gained basic user access (through phishing, for example) could leverage this flaw to escalate into full control of the SAP environment.\nSAP, for its part,\nwarned\n: “This flaw operates as a backdoor, allowing unauthorized access to SAP systems and jeopardizing confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Without immediate mitigation, your SAP S/4HANA system could be severely compromised.” The post makes no mention of active exploitation.\nOther vulnerabilities SAP reported Tuesday affected a range of products, including SAP Business One, SAP Landscape Transformation Replication Server, SAP Commerce Cloud, SAP Datahub, SAP Business Planning and Consolidation, SAP HCM, SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform, SAP Supplier Relationship Management, and Fiori. Severity ratings of those vulnerabilities range from 3.1 to 8.8.\nAll vulnerabilities mentioned in this post, particularly those with high severity ratings, should be patched as soon as possible.

You can speak back, and your iPhone will show what you're saying in their language.

Apple's language is ambiguous during the section, and looking at the comparison pages for different AirPods models after the event reveals that more models will get this feature.\nSpecifically, it's the\nAirPods Pro 2\nand\nAirPods 4 with ANC\nthat will get it. This makes sense – they both use the same H2 chip as the AirPods Pro 3, and both have active noise cancellation, so that the buds can quieten down the person's speech in your ears and fill in the translation instead.\nThe cheapest\nAirPods 4\nhave the H2 chip, but don't have active noise cancellation, so they will miss out on the feature. And the\nAirPods Max\nhave the older H1 chip, so miss out on this along with so many other features – including\nother new AirPods features announced for iOS 26\n.\nApple says \"Live Translation with AirPods works on AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and AirPods Pro 2 and later with the latest firmware when paired with an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone running iOS 26 and later.\"\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nAs for the languages supported by Live Translation, Apple says: \"Live Translation on AirPods is available in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish, and will be coming to four more languages by the end of the year: Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified).\"\nIf you want to see a full rundown of how all the different AirPods models compare for features, here's a big ol' list.\nToday's best Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation deals\n13 Amazon customer reviews\n☆\n☆\n☆\n☆\n☆\n$238.60\nView\n$249\nView\nNo price information\nCheck Walmart\nShow more\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\nToday's best Apple AirPods 4 Active Noise Cancellation deals\n$179.95\n$138.98\nView\n$436\n$207.59\nView\nNo price information\nCheck Amazon\nShow more\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n(Image credit: Future)\nSee more Earbuds and Airpods News\nTOPICS\nApple\nMatt Bolton\nSocial Links Navigation\nManaging Editor, Entertainment\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

Here’s a look at the\nnew iPhone 17\n, Apple’s base model this year, which is joined by the thinner\niPhone Air\nand beefier\niPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max\n— there’s no Plus this time around.\nThe first place to start is the rear camera. Not because a lot has changed here, but rather because it hasn’t: while the iPhone 17 Pro and Air have both adopted new horizontal camera “plateaus,” the regular 17 has the same two vertically stacked lenses as last year. That means this is the only iPhone 17 that actually looks like the\niPhone 16 range\n— which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on your perspective.\nRelated\nApple’s iPhone 17 drops the Plus, but gains a bigger, faster display\niPhone Air hands-on\nOur first look at the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max\nThe dual rear cameras look the same, but there’s been a big change. Both lenses now use 48-megapixel sensors — a big upgrade for the ultrawide, which was previously 12 megapixels. Apple claims that the main camera will double as a 2x telephoto, while the ultrawide handles macro duties, but don’t expect a camera as versatile as those on the Pros — still, it’s better than the single lens on the Air. The selfie camera has been upgraded too, with an 18-megapixel sensor supported by Center Stage for automatic framing and even orientation adjustment.\nThe regular iPhone is always the last to get whatever shiny new features Apple rolls out to the Pros, but it looks especially left behind this year with the Air in the mix and a new design for the Pro. But the selfie camera improvements will be appreciated here by anyone upgrading to the base model, and the colors are pleasantly saturated in person.\nYou’ll get five color options with the base iPhone 17: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage. They’re all at the subdued, pastel end of the spectrum though — bizarrely, you’ll have to opt for the 17 Pro’s bright orange to get a truly punchy finish this year.\nThat’s not to say that nothing has changed. The iPhone 17 has followed in the footsteps of last year’s\n16 Pro models\nby shrinking its bezel for a slightly larger display, jumping from 6.1 inches in the iPhone 16 to 6.3 inches now. That means it has the same size display as the iPhone 17 Pro, giving you one less reason to upgrade.\nSize isn’t the only upgrade, either. This is the first year that the base iPhone has included support for up to 120Hz refresh rates, finally matching a feature you can find on $200 Android phones. That should mean smoother scrolling and more fluid animations, helped along by the upgraded A19 chip — it’s a change that’s sometimes hard to notice at first, but is immediately apparent when you go back to a 60Hz screen. It’s also a brighter screen than before, with a peak outdoor brightness of 3,000 nits, and is protected by the new, tougher Ceramic Shield 2.\nThrow in more power thanks to the updated A19 chipset, longer battery life, and support for faster 25W MagSafe charging, and the iPhone 17 is a bigger update than many of us expected.\nThe iPhone 17 starts at $799, the same price as the 16, but you get double the storage at 256GB. It’ll be available to order from this Friday, with devices hitting store shelves on September 19th.\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nAllison Johnson\nClose\nAllison Johnson\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nAllison Johnson\nDominic Preston\nClose\nDominic Preston\nNews Editor\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nDominic Preston\nApple\nClose\nApple\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nApple\nApple Event\nClose\nApple Event\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nApple Event\nHands-on\nClose\nHands-on\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nHands-on\niPhone\nClose\niPhone\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\niPhone\nReviews\nClose\nReviews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nReviews\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMore in this stream\nSee all\nApple barely talked about AI at its big iPhone 17 event\nHayden Field\nAn hour ago\nThe iPhone 17 comes with Apple’s new in-house networking chip\nEmma Roth\nAn hour ago\nApple’s new MagSafe battery is only designed for the new iPhone Air\nJay Peters\nAn hour ago\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nGoogle admits the open web is in ‘rapid decline’\niPhone 17 event live blog: on the ground at Apple’s keynote\nAll the news from Apple’s iPhone 17 keynote\nApple announces AirPods Pro 3\nApple announces the ultra-slim iPhone Air\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

That’s the best news about Apple’s tablet lineup: 15 years after Steve Jobs first debuted the device, the iPad is the best tablet on the market, and it’s not particularly close. Apple’s App Store is enormous and filled with great apps, Apple’s performance and battery life are consistently excellent, and the iPad is still the company’s most versatile device. That’s one easy answer to your question: yes, if you want a tablet you should buy an iPad. Even last year’s iPad, or heck, last-last year... [truncated]",

    "source": "This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise\n$300 billion, five-year agreement\n, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure.\nOn the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it.\nChirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors.\n“OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.”\nSome industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before, and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business.\n“Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said.\nPayment and power\nBut even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain.\nTechcrunch event\nJoin 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\nNetflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has\npainted a rosy picture of its future prospects\nin terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year.\nPower is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute.\nIndustry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though\nsolar and batteries\nare arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also\nbetting big on nuclear\n.\nDespite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI’s anticipated growth isn’t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a\nreport\nthe Rhodium Group published yesterday.\nCompute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have\nbought thousands of Nvidia chips\nto ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe\nMeta owns that now\n).\nBut compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up\nsolar farms\n, buying\nnuclear power plants\n, and inking deals with\ngeothermal startups\n.\nSo far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including\nOklo\n,\nHelion\n, and\nExowatt\n, but the company itself hasn’t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon.\nWith a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change.\nThe company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI’s future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricy infrastructure.\nTopics\nAI\n,\ndata centers\n,\nEnterprise\n,\nOpenAI\n,\noracle\nTim De Chant\nSenior Reporter, Climate\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

That amounts to 12.5 million EVs, although the data combines both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs for the total.\nHowever, that's for global sales. In fact, EV adoption is moving even faster in Europe, which has grown by 31 percent so far this year (Rho says that BEV sales grew by 31 percent but PHEV sales by just 30 percent)—a total of 2.6 million plug-in vehicles. In some European countries, the increase has been even more impressive: up by 45 percent in Germany, 41 percent in Italy, and by 100 percent in Spain.\nBut despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year.\nTesla has seen none of this sales growth in Europe, however—as we noted last month, this region's Tesla sales collapsed by 40 percent in July.\nChina had bought an additional 7.6 million new EVs between January and August of this year, although this growth slowed in July and August, partially as a consequence of robust sales during those months in 2024 thanks to Chinese government policies. And as also noted last month, BYD recently saw a drop in profitability and has downgraded its sales target by 900,000 vehicles (down to 4.6 million) for this year.\nMeanwhile, here in North America, things aren't quite so hot. EV sales are still growing but barely—up just 6 percent between January and August 2025 compared to the same time period in 2024. August was actually a good month for EV sales in the US as consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the\nIRS 30D tax credit\nfor clean vehicles,\nwhich disappears\nat the end of September.\nThat's\na result of anti-EV policies\nput in place by President Trump and Republicans in Congress, and it's\nfar from the only one\n. Other tax credits intended to foster EV adoption by businesses are also being eradicated. The Environmental Protection Agency is\nno longer fining automakers\nfor failing to meet fleet averages, and the Trump administration has clawed back money earmarked for charging infrastructure.\n\"Global EV sales have now reached 12.5 million units in the opening eight months of the year,\" said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester. \"The North American market has reached a record monthly high as consumers in the US accelerate purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expires at the end of September. Momentum remains in Europe, underpinned by the emissions legislation, with major automotive countries, Germany and the UK, growing by 45 percent and 31 percent [year to date], respectively. [Year on year] growth in the Chinese market slowed in July–August 2025, however, this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade-in scheme increased last year, which spurred on EV demand in the country,\" Lester said.\nJonathan M.

Spencer Cox described the sequence of events that led to the capture of Robinson, 22, who was turned into the police by his father. They also clarified the nature of the notes engraved on the bullet casings found at the scene, which had been rumored to be slogans relating to antifascist and “transgender ideology.” As it turns out, the messages are a confusing mix of internet memes and pop culture.\nAs described, the bullets read (exact capitalization not confirmed at this point):\n“Notices bulges OWO what’s this?”\n“Hey fascist! Catch!” Up arrow symbol, right arrow, three down arrow symbols\n“Oh bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao”\n“If you read this, you are gay lmao”\nThe first bullet casing, which was fired, is a meme referring to furry online roleplay, according to\nKnow Your Meme\n.\nIt’s not hard to see where the “antifascist” conclusion came from on two of the other bullets: “Bella ciao” is an Italian song adopted by partisans and resistance fighters while Italy was governed by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Cox said in response to a question during the conference that the “hey fascist” message “speaks for itself.” Three downward-slanting arrows are a symbol used by both historical and contemporary antifascists.\nBut the full arrow sequence was quickly recognized as something else: a combo from\nHelldivers 2\nfor calling the\nEagle 500kg Bomb\nstratagem. The world of\nHelldivers\n— which evokes Robert Heinlein’s book\nStarship Troopers\nand the subsequent movie — concerns fascism thematically; developer Arrowhead has\ncharacterized it as a satire\nwhere players fight for a fascist state.\nAs for the use of “Bella ciao,” the song has no obvious connection but given its historical significance, unsurprisingly does appear in a\nHelldivers 2\nmod, as well as in at least one other video game, a World War II-themed strategy game called\nHearts of Iron IV\n.\nThe fatal shooting of Kirk on Wednesday led to an intense manhunt across Utah, though it encountered numerous complications along the way. Several leads, publicly teased by FBI Director Kash Patel, quickly petered out. Leaked documents from law enforcement published by MAGA influencers led to false narratives about how markings on the bullet indicated that the shooter was in favor of “transgender ideology.”\nIt was nearly impossible to divorce politics and internet misinformation from Kirk’s death, however. The 31-year-old was a powerful figure in the MAGA movement, as the founder and leader of the right-wing college group Turning Point USA, and a prominent podcaster and MAGA influencer himself, famous for appearing on college campuses to confront liberal students. President Donald Trump credited Kirk and TPUSA as a factor in his return to office, and frequently relied on him as an emissary to youth voters.\nThe messages on the shooter’s bullet casings can best be described as bizarre and extremely online\nIn the aftermath of Kirk’s death, his allies in the MAGA movement, including lawmakers and influencers, promised swift retribution against the left should the killer share their ideology. The themes of\nHelldivers 2\ncould have an ideological meaning, albeit not necessarily a straightforward one. But ultimately, the messages on the shooter’s bullet casings can best be described as bizarre and extremely online.\nAccording to the FBI, evidence leading to Robinson’s arrest included screenshots from his roommate’s Discord chat, in which he mentioned leaving a rifle wrapped in a towel in some bushes. Law enforcement recovered a Mauser .30-06 from an area near the campus that was wrapped in a towel.\nFans of the game immediately noticed. Shortly after the press conference on Friday morning, the\nHelldivers\nsubreddit was flooded with players who had picked up on what may be references to the game. A thread, now deleted, was titled: “Hey Facist Catch!” with the poster asking, “Did anyone else hear/notice?!” A commenter, responding to the thread, said, “The moment I heard [the arrows] my eyes widened.”\nAnother thread, also apparently deleted by moderators, referenced the arrows that authorities say were on one of the unfired bullet casings recovered at the scene. “It sickens me having people like this playing this game and using it to real violence to tarnish this awesome game and community,” the poster wrote. Other posts implored the subreddit moderators to lock down the forum. Moderators for the subreddit didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A\nthread in the separate r/Helldivers2 subreddit\nremains active, with people discussing the apparent parallels.\nArrowhead, the maker of the\nHelldivers\ngames, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nTina Nguyen\nClose\nTina Nguyen\nSenior Reporter, Washington\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nTina Nguyen\nMia Sato\nClose\nMia Sato\nFeatures Writer, The Verge\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nMia Sato\nGaming\nClose\nGaming\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGaming\nNews\nClose\nNews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nNews\nPolicy\nClose\nPolicy\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPolicy\nPolitics\nClose\nPolitics\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPolitics\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nCharlie Kirk’s alleged killer scratched bullets with a Helldivers combo and a furry sex meme\nInternet detectives are misusing AI to find Charlie Kirk’s alleged shooter\nWhy does Apple think three lenses are eight lenses?\nXbox Cloud is getting a much-needed upgrade\nApple Watch hypertension alerts cleared by FDA for new and old watches\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there’s a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.”\nSpecifically, Taylor compared today’s AI landscape to the dot-com bubble of the late ‘90s.

I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there’s a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.”\nSpecifically, Taylor compared today’s AI landscape to the dot-com bubble of the late ‘90s.

These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.”\nSelf-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through\nnuclear fission\n, in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases.\nThe Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing\n400 gigawatts\nby 2050. To help achieve that goal, scientific institutions like the Idaho National Laboratory, a leading research institute in nuclear energy, are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel. Companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs, a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector. For example, Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based nuclear power company, plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal.\nHowever, the road to renaissance is filled with familiar obstacles. Nuclear energy infrastructure is “too expensive to build, and it takes too long to build,” said Allison Macfarlane, a science and technology policy expert at the University of British Columbia who used to chair the NRC from 2012 to 2014.\nAnd experts are divided on whether new nuclear technologies, such as small versions of reactors, are ready for primetime. The nuclear energy field is now “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization that has long acted as a\nnuclear safety watchdog\n.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy by\nweakening the NRC\n, Lyman said. “The message is that it's regulation that has been the obstacle to deploying nuclear power, and if we just get rid of all this red tape, then the industry is going to thrive,” he added. “I think that's really misplaced.”\nAlthough streamlining the approval process might accelerate development, the true problem lies in the high costs of nuclear, which would need to be significantly cheaper to compete with other sources of energy such as natural gas, said Koroush Shirvan, a nuclear science researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Even the license-ready reactors are still not economical,” he said. If the newer reactor technologies do pan out, without government support and subsidies, Shirvan said, it is difficult to imagine them “coming online before 2035.”\nIt’s déjá vu all over again\nR\numblings of a\nnuclear renaissance give experts a sense of déjà vu. The first resurgence in interest was around 2005, when many thought that nuclear energy could mitigate climate change and be an energy alternative to dwindling supply and rising prices of fossil fuels. But that enthusiasm slowed mainly after the Fukushima accident in 2011, in which a tsunami-triggered power outage—along with multiple safety failures—led to a nuclear meltdown at a facility in Japan. “So, the first nuclear renaissance fizzled out,” said Lyman.\nGlobally, the proportion of electricity provided by nuclear energy has been dwindling. Although there has been an increase in generation, nuclear energy has\ncontributed less\nto the share of global electricity demand, dropping to 9 percent in 2024 from a peak of about 17 percent in 2001. In the US, 94 reactors generate about a\nfifth\nof the nation’s electricity, a proportion that has held steady since 1990s. But only two of those reactors have come online in the last nearly 30 years.\nThis renewed push is “a second bite at the apple, and we’ll have to see but it does seem to have a lot more of a headwind now,” said Lyman.\nMuch of that movement comes from the private sector, said Todd Allen, a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan. In the last couple of decades, dozens of nuclear energy companies have emerged, including TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates. “It feels more like normal capitalism than we ever had in nuclear,” Allen said. Those companies are working on developing the large reactors that have been the backbone of nuclear energy for decades, as well as newer technologies that can bolster the field.\nProponents say\nsmall modular reactors\n, or SMRs, and microreactors, which generate less than 300 megawatts and 20 megawatts, respectively, could offer safer, cheaper, and more flexible energy compared to their more traditional counterparts. (Large reactors have, on average, 900 megawatts of capacity.) One 2022\nstudy\nfound that modularization can reduce construction time by up to 60 percent.\nThese designs have taken the spotlight: In 2024,\na report estimated\nthat the SMR market would reach $295 billion by 2043. In June, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Congress that DOE will have\nat least three SMRs running\nby July of next year. And in July of this year, the Nuclear Energy Agency launched a\ndashboard to track SMR technologies\naround the world, which identified 74 SMR designs at different stages around the world. The first commercial SMR in North America is currently being constructed in Canada, with plans to be operational by 2030.\nBut whether SMRs and microreactors are actually safer and more cost-effective remains to be determined. A 2022\nstudy\nfound that SMRs would likely produce more leakage and nuclear waste than conventional reactors. Studying them, though, is difficult since so few are currently operational.\nIn part, that may be because of cost. Multiple\nanalyses\nhave concluded that, because of rising construction and operating costs, SMRs might not be financially viable enough to compete for the world’s energy markets, including in\ndeveloping countries\nthat lack affordable access to electricity.\nAnd recent ventures have hit road bumps: For example, NuScale, the only SMR developer with a design approved by the NRC, had to shut down its operations in November 2023 due to increasingly high costs (though another uprated SMR design was approved earlier this year).\n“Nothing is really commercialized yet,” said Macfarlane. Most of the tech companies haven’t figured out expenses, supply chains, the kind of waste they are going to produce or security at their reactors, she added.\nFuel supply\nis also a barrier since most plants use uranium enriched at low rates, but SMRs and microreactors use uranium enriched at higher levels, which is typically sourced from Russia and not commercially available in the US. So scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory are working to recover enriched uranium from existing reactors and developed new, more cost-effective fuels, said Jess Gehin, the associate laboratory director for the Nuclear Science & Technology Directorate at the INL. They are also using artificial intelligence and modeling simulation tools and capabilities to optimize nuclear energy systems, he added: “We got to reach 400 gigawatts, we need to accelerate all of this.”\nCompanies are determined to face and surpass these barriers. Some have begun pouring concrete, such as one nuclear company called Kairos Power that began building a demo of their SMR design in Tennessee; the plant is\nprojected\nto be fully operational by 2027. “I would make the case that we're moving faster than many in the field, if not the fastest,” Mike Laufer, the company’s CEO and co-founder,\ntold Reuters\nlast year.\nSome experts think achieving nuclear expansion can be done—and revel in the progress so far: “I would have never thought we'd be in this position where we're working so hard to expand nuclear, because for most of my career, it wasn't that way,” said Gehin. “And I would say each month that goes by exceeds my expectations on the next bigger things that are coming.\"\nDoing more with less?\nA\nlthough the\nTrump administration aims to accelerate nuclear energy through executive orders, in practice, it has not allocated new funding yet, said Matt Bowen, an expert on nuclear energy, waste, and nonproliferation at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In fact, the initial White House\nbudget proposed\ncutting $4.7 billion from the Department of Energy, including $408 million from the Office of Nuclear Energy allocated for nuclear research in the 2026 fiscal year.\n“The administration was proposing cuts to Office of Nuclear Energy and DOE more broadly, and DOGE is pushing staff out,” said Bowen. “How do you do more with less? Less staff, less money.”\nThe Trump administration places the blame for the nuclear sector’s stagnation on the NRC, which oversees licensing and recertification processes that cost the industry millions of dollars each year in compliance. In his executive orders, Trump called for a major reorganization of the NRC. Some of the proposed changes, like streamlining the approval process (which can take years for new plants), may be welcomed because “for a long time, they were very, very, very slow,” said Charles Forsberg, a nuclear chemical engineer at MIT. But there are worries that the executive orders could do more than cut red tape.\n“Every word in those orders is of concern, because the thrust of those orders is to essentially strip the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of its independence from the executive branch, essentially nullifying the original purpose,” said Lyman.\nSome experts fear that with these new constraints, NRC staff will have less time and fewer resources to do their jobs, which could impact power plant safety in the future. Bowen said: “This notion that the problem for nuclear energy is regulation, and so all we need to do is deregulate, is both wrong and also really problematic.”\nThe next few decades will tell whether nuclear, especially SMRs, can overcome economic and technical challenges to safely contribute to decarbonization efforts. Some, like Gehin, are optimistic. “I think we're going to accelerate,” he said. “We certainly can achieve a dramatic deployment if we put our mindset to it.”\nBut making nuclear financially competitive will take serious commitment from the government and the dozens of companies, with many still skeptical, Shirvan said. “I am quite, I would say, on the pessimistic scale when it comes to the future of nuclear energy in the US.”\nThis article was originally published on\nUndark\n.

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.\nWe only just put Apple’s\niPhone 17 launch event\nbehind us, but\nBloomberg’s\nMark Gurman is already glancing into his crystal ball to see what’s next for the company. In today’s\nPower On\nnewsletter Gurman says that there are at least 10 more products from Apple that are expected to launch either later this year or in the first half of 2026.\nSome of those products have been rumored for some time, or are just kind of obvious upgrades. The M5 iPad Pro, for instance, is a matter of when not if. Though the rumors that it will have a\nsecond front facing camera\nfor those that prefer to use their iPad in portrait mode is interesting. The iPad Pro could be the first Apple product with an\nM5\nas it’s expected to launch in October, with upgraded MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs to follow in early 2026.\nGurman also claims that a budget-friendly iPhone 17e is in the works for early next year. Upgrades over the 16e are expected to be pretty minor, with most of the handset remaining the same, but moving to the new A19 chip inside the iPhone 17 line. The Apple TV and HomePod mini are also expected to get updates next year with processor bumps along with support for the\nnew version of Siri\nand Apple Intelligence features. Same with the\nVision Pro\n, which is expected to get an M4 processor and an improved headband, but otherwise remain largely unchanged while a larger update is in the works for 2027.\nPerhaps the most interesting thing on the list is the long-rumored\nsmart home hub\ncode-named J490. Early chatter suggested that the smart display would launch this past March but, clearly, the device never materialized. Now Gurman claims it should launch in the spring. It would mark the first new major product category for Apple in a while, but one that it’s largely laid the groundwork for between the HomePod and iPad.\nRounding out the rumors are\nAirTag 2\nand a pair of new monitors.

    "source": "Robinhood\nannounced\nMonday it has filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a new publicly traded fund that will hold shares of startups.\nThe idea behind the \"Robinhood Ventures Fund I\" is to allow every retail investor access to\nmake money on the hottest startups before they go public.\nWhile the current version of the\napplication is public,\nRobinhood hasn’t filled in the fine-print yet. This means we don’t know how many shares it plans to sell, nor other details like the management fee it plans to charge. It’s also unclear which startups it hopes this fund will eventually hold. The paperwork says it \"expects\" to invest in aerospace and defense, AI, fintech, robotics as well as software for consumers and enterprises.\nRobinhood’s big pitch is that retail investors are being left out of the gains that are amassed by startup investors like\nVCs. That’s true to an extent. \"Accredited investors\"\n—\nor those with a net worth large enough to handle\nriskier investments —\nalready have a variety of ways of buying equity in startups, such as with venture firms like\nOurCrowd\n.\nRetail investors that are not rich enough to be accredited have more limited options. There are funds similar to what Robinhood has proposed, including Cathy Wood’s ARK Venture Fund, a mutual fund which holds stakes in companies like Anthropic, Databricks, OpenAI, SpaceX, and others.\nRobinhood’s last such effort was controversial. The trading company\nlaunched what it called private \"tokenized\" stocks\nin the EU earlier this year, implying these tokens gave retail investors the ability to make money from\nshares of private companies like OpenAI. However,\nOpenAI denounced the product\n, pointing out that buyers of these tokens were not actually buying OpenAI stock — tokenized or otherwise. They were simply buying tokens pegged to prices of a private company’s stock.\nThis new closed-end \"Ventures Fund I\" is a more classic, mutual fund-style, approach. As to when Robinhood’s new fund will be available we don’t know that either yet.

However, until semiconductor tariffs are announced, \"it's impossible\" for any tech company to make the kind of long-term plans that could help keep consumer prices low as Trump's negotiations with foreign partners and investigations into various products drag on, Brzytwa said.\nAhead of the busy holiday shopping season, Brzytwa suggested that many companies may be prepared to maintain prices, based on front-loading of inventory by firms in anticipation of more complicated tariff regimes coming. But\nsome\ncompanies\n, notably in the video game industry, have already begun warning of tariff-related price hikes, Brzytwa noted, and for others likely delaying for as long as they can, there remains a question of \"what happens when that inventory disappears?\"\nFor the next two months, CTA plans to monitor the situation, Brzytwa said. That research will result in studies revealing \"who bears the burden of the tariffs\" and \"what the long-term ramifications are going to be for consumer technology companies when it comes to lost sales because of potentially higher prices due to the tariffs,\" Brzytwa said.\nIn the meantime, Brzytwa warned that tech firms are preparing for what CTA has dubbed \"a possible triple whammy.\" To help Ars readers understand how things are about to get even more complicated, Brzytwa explained why \"tariff stacking\"—where manufacturers may be double-, triple-, or possibly even quadruple-taxed on products that may contain materials subjected to individual tariffs, like semiconductors, polysilicon, or copper—has become a \"bureaucratic nightmare\" for makers of consumer electronics struggling to estimate total tariff impacts.\n\"Where does it stop?\" Brzytwa posited. \"We don't know. So 'triple whammy' might be an understatement.\"\nAshley Belanger\nSenior Policy Reporter\nAshley Belanger\nSenior Policy Reporter\nAshley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated to tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.

How the two multi-room ecosystems compare – and whether you should switch\nFeatures\nBy\nSimon Cohen\npublished\n15 September 2025\nA new multi-room maestro to rule them all?\nComments\n(0)\n(\n)\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\nHere’s how it works\n.\n(Image credit: Future)\nJump to:\nHardware compared\nSoftware compared\nMusic sources compared\n'Connect' apps compared\nAdvanced audio compared\nVerdict: Should you switch?\nFor much of the last decade,\nSonos\nhas defined wireless multi-room audio. The company's easy and intuitive software helped it grow its business from a few small speakers and hi-fi add-ons to a behemoth with multiple soundbars, subwoofers, portable outdoor speakers, and even a pretty\nfantastic set of noise-cancelling headphones\n. Then, in 2024, disaster.\nA\nbotched software redesign\nrendered some people’s Sonos systems nearly useless, while many more\ncomplained of missing or broken features, usability concerns, and general instability\n.\nMore than a year later, things are much better, with\nSonos even agreeing that its speakers now sound better following a firmware update\n, but the fiasco has still not been entirely resolved. Trust in Sonos as a company is far lower, leading many Sonos faithful to look at alternatives.\nYou may like\nEdifier ES300 vs Sonos Move 2: my testing reveals which Wi-Fi speaker offers substantially better sound\nI review wireless speakers for a living and most succumb to this one major flaw – here's the one that doesn't\nBest Sonos speakers and soundbars, as rated by our expert reviewers\nInstead of switching to similarly priced offerings from Bose, Denon, and Bluesound, disenchanted Sonos owners have taken notice of WiiM, a comparatively tiny brand with two big advantages: an app that reminds people of Sonos in its heyday, alongside hardware prices that seem impossibly low.\nWiiM still has a ways to go before it can duplicate Sonos’ broad offering, but given its pace, now’s a\ngreat\ntime to compare the two platforms and see if you should switch – or perhaps begin your multi-room journey with WiiM instead.\n(Image credit: Future)\nSonos vs WiiM: Hardware\nSince the\nbest wireless speakers\n(ie. those with Wi-Fi support baked in) are the cornerstone of most multi-room systems, let’s get one big obvious difference out of the way: WiiM doesn’t make wireless speakers. Yet.\nThat’s about to change. WiiM\nhas announced its first wireless speaker, the WiiM Sound\n, which is expected to launch in the fall of 2025 – and it honestly looks a lot like the\nHomePod 'hub' with screen tipped for a 2025 release\nthat still hasn't materialised. In the meantime, a partnership with Swedish audio firm\nAudioPro has created two WiiM-compatible speakers\n: the WiiM Edition AudioPro A10 MKII and the excellent Audio Pro C10MK II (which you can read more about in our full-fat\nAudio Pro C10MK II review\n).\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nBut for the most part, WiiM’s device lineup is made up of network music streamers. Some, like the WiiM Mini, sell for just $99 and need to be connected to an external amplifier and speakers. Others, like the WiiM Amp ($299), combine streaming, amplification, and an HDMI input, turning them into full-fledged audio receivers — you only need to add your own speakers.\n(Image credit: Future / Simon Lucas)\nToday's best Audio Pro Addon C10 MkII deals\n$480\nView\n$480\nView\n$480\nView\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\nVirtually all of these devices have been met with very positive feedback from buyers and professional reviewers alike. And it’s hard to ignore their prices. In terms of sheer functionality, there’s little difference between the $99 WiiM Mini and the $449 Sonos Port, or between the $299 WiiM Amp and the $699\nSonos Amp\n.\nAnother thing that’s hard to ignore: all of WiiM’s devices not only provide Bluetooth connectivity (something Sonos has only adopted on its newest products), but they’re two-way as opposed to receive-only. This gives WiiM products the ability to stream to wireless headphones, something Sonos can only do when you combine its Sonos Ace headphones with one of its Dolby Atmos soundbars.\nYou may like\nEdifier ES300 vs Sonos Move 2: my testing reveals which Wi-Fi speaker offers substantially better sound\nI review wireless speakers for a living and most succumb to this one major flaw – here's the one that doesn't\nBest Sonos speakers and soundbars, as rated by our expert reviewers\nWiiM sells a wireless subwoofer – the recently introduced\nWiiM Sub Pro\n– but in a seeming case of putting the cart before the horse, there aren’t any WiiM soundbars (again, yet). Sonos, on the other hand, does it all, from speakers to subwoofers to soundbars, and as we mentioned in the intro, even headphones.\nAnd despite its ongoing software woes, Sonos’ hardware has typically been met with unbridled enthusiasm. Its current entry-level speaker, the\n$199 Sonos Era 100\n, doubles as an Alexa-powered smart speaker, works with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and can be connected to external analog sources like turntables or TVs.\nThe step-up\nEra 300 ($449)\ndoes all of that and is one of the few non-soundbar speakers that can play Dolby Atmos Music. Its\nMove 2\nand\nRoam 2\nportables work as Bluetooth speakers when on the go and then transition back to Wi-Fi when you’re home. And its flagship soundbar, the\n$999 Arc Ultra\n, thanks to Sonos’ built-in expandability, is simultaneously one of the best single-speaker and multi-speaker home theater products you can buy.\nIt’s a hardware ecosystem that arguably has no equals, at any price.\nThe best Sonos Era 100 deals live now\n34 Amazon customer reviews\n☆\n☆\n☆\n☆\n☆\n$199\nView\n$199\nView\n$249\nView\nShow more\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n(Image credit: Future)\nSonos vs WiiM: Software\nAs impressive as Sonos’ speaker lineup is, plenty of other wireless audio choices exist. In fact, it’s hard to name an audio brand that doesn’t have wireless options. What has always allowed Sonos to differentiate itself from these alternatives is its software.\nUntil 2024, the Sonos app was miles ahead of the competition. It took all the headaches out of setting up a new speaker (including room calibration), it gave quick and easy management of all the Sonos components in your home (including device grouping), and it had an exceptional universal search capability. Handy extras like alarms and sleep timers expanded what you could do with your speakers.\nFrom the beginning, Sonos provided easy access to your personal music collection, whether it lived on a network storage device or embedded into an iTunes library on a laptop. But Sonos also struck deals with every major streaming music service (and dozens of minor ones), letting it integrate their music catalogs directly into the Sonos app. Want to create a playlist with songs from your personal library and Spotify? Sonos lets you do that. Want to skip between an internet radio station and your current Audible audiobook? You didn’t need to leave the Sonos app.\nApple\ndevice owners could also opt not to use the app, as most Sonos devices support Apple AirPlay, which lets you stream directly from any audio app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\n(Image credit: Future)\nIn short, there was almost nothing you couldn’t do via Sonos’ highly intuitive software.\nSince 2024’s infamous app update, that’s all still true in theory. In practice, the app still isn’t as responsive or reliable as it should be, and the redesigned user interface is much less intuitive. Instead of the previous, tab-based layout, which provided dedicated spots for the most commonly used functions (like devices and search), there’s now a semi-customizable, rows-of-icons home screen with a heavy focus on content. Search and devices must be accessed via drop-down or pull-up menus.\nThe one major improvement to Sonos’ software architecture is the addition of a web-based interface. Even if you have more than one Sonos system, you can manage all of them from one console.\nIn many ways, WiiM’s software is a throwback to pre-2024 Sonos. You’ll find nearly every feature has been duplicated, including quick setup, room calibration, device grouping, universal search, alarms and timers, and native support for both personal libraries and streaming music services.\nThe WiiM Home app uses tabs just like the previous version of the Sonos app, with activities like accessing favorites, browsing music, managing your devices, and searching organized into discrete pages. Want to flip back and forth between searching and browsing for music? One tap is all you need.\nIt’s not just the layout and menus that will feel instantly recognizable to longtime Sonos users. The WiiM Home’s snappy performance is like a breath of fresh air, compared to the sluggishness of the new Sonos app.\n(Image credit: Future)\nSonos vs. Wiim: Music sources\nI don’t know how many Sonos owners routinely listen to multiple music streaming services, but it’s nice knowing that with support for over 130 services, no matter where you get your tunes, it can be added to the Sonos app.\nSonos also remains one of the very few multi-room audio companies that has permission to embed\nApple Music\ninto its software. This is vital for Apple device owners who want to experience lossless and/or hi-res playback on their Sonos speakers.\nOn most wireless speakers, Apple requires you to stream directly from the Apple Music app via AirPlay 2, which doesn’t support lossless or hi-res playback. The only other way to do it is on an Android device (assuming your speaker supports Google Cast.)\nWith 21 compatible services, WiiM’s native music integration can’t compete with Sonos. Still, of all the major players, only Apple Music isn’t on that list – but of course, that's a big issue for Apple Music subscribers.\n(Image credit: Future)\nSonos vs. WiiM: Apple AirPlay, Google Cast, and 'Connect' apps\nSince we just covered the differences in how Sonos and WiiM handle Apple Music, here’s a quick caveat about Apple AirPlay on WiiM devices: some support it, while others don’t.\nWe don’t know why, but WiiM’s first four devices (Mini, Pro, Pro Plus, and Amp) all included support for Apple AirPlay, while its three newest devices (Amp Pro, Ultra, and Amp Ultra) lack this feature. WiiM hasn’t provided any guidance on the future of AirPlay support.\nWhat does this mean? Given the lack of native Apple Music support within the WiiM Home app, unless you want to use Bluetooth, the only way to stream Apple Music from an iPhone to a WiiM device is to buy one of Wiim’s older models or one of the WiiM Edition Audio Pro speakers.\nEvery Sonos (and Sonos-compatible) speaker and component made since 2017’s Sonos One supports AirPlay.\nOn the flip side, none of Sonos’ products work with Google Cast, making ad-hoc streaming from an Android audio app difficult or impossible, whereas Google Cast is supported on all WiiM devices.\nSimilarly, Tidal Connect works on WiiM but not Sonos, and the same is true of Qobuz Connect. Spotify Connect works on both platforms, even with the free subscription tier.\nThanks to Sonos’ massive number of natively supported music services, its lack of compatibility with Google Cast and Connect-enabled apps might not impact you, unless you’re focused on getting the highest resolution possible.\nFor instance, Tidal subscribers can access hi-res audio up to 24-bit/192kHz. But Sonos’ native Tidal integration is limited to CD quality (16-bit/44.1kHz). Without alternatives like Google Cast or Tidal Connect, this limitation can’t be avoided.\n(Image credit: Future)\nSonos vs. WiiM: Advanced audio settings\nIf there’s one area where WiiM solidly eclipses Sonos, it’s the platform’s support for audio formats and EQ.\nSonos is compatible with major lossy and lossless audio codecs, but only up to a maximum resolution of 24-bit/48kHz. The Arc, Arc Ultra, Beam Gen 2, and Era 300 also support Dolby Atmos Music.\nFor tuning, each Sonos component has a bass and treble adjustment, along with an optional loudness mode. For those who aren’t interested in deeper tweaks, this is likely more than enough control.\nWiiM, by contrast, has a huge range of adjustments. Except for Dolby Atmos Music, it supports all of the same formats as Sonos, and can also handle DSD files (albeit non-natively). It can decode these files/streams at up to 24-bit/192kHz, giving audiophiles a level of hi-res playback that Sonos can’t match.\nWithin the settings for devices like the\nWiiM Pro music streamer\nand Pro Plus, you can define the maximum resolutions for both the digital inputs and outputs – a handy feature that ensures your upstream and downstream equipment gets the best possible signal.\nWiiM also lets you choose between three kinds of equalization: 24 EQ presets, a manual 10-band graphic equalizer, or, for those who are comfortable altering their EQ Q values, there’s also a 10-band parametric equalizer.\nIf you’re a fan of Roon’s subscription-based music management and streaming software, Wiim is a much better choice – all of its devices are Roon certified except the Wiim Mini. While some Sonos devices have been tested to work with Roon, Sonos doesn’t officially support the platform.\n(Image credit: Future)\nThe best WiiM Amp Pro deals live today\n$379\nView\nNo price information\nCheck Walmart\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\n(Image credit: Future)\nSonos vs Wiim: Should you switch?\nIf you’re a longtime Sonos user, with multiple speakers and devices throughout your home, you’ve likely invested thousands of dollars in your system. If you’re also a power user, you’ve probably invested a lot of time too, creating custom playlists, setting up alarms, and adding multiple streaming services. In short, you would have to be really unhappy with the Sonos app to make switching feel worthwhile.\nEven then, you’d have to make a lot of compromises. With no WiiM soundbars or speakers (either fixed or portable), you’re looking at replacing your Sonos speakers with AudioPro’s two WiiM Edition models, and/or WiiM’s streaming amps with a set of passive wired speakers.\nIf this sounds like you, my advice is to stay the course. The Sonos app still isn’t as stable or easy to use as it was before the redesign, but it’s leagues better than it was when the company launched it. And since Sonos has every incentive to keep improving it, I have every reason to believe it will.\nHowever, if your Sonos setup is simple – perhaps a couple of Sonos Ones and a Sonos Port – and you’re frustrated by both the app and the technical limitations of the platform, now’s a good time to think of moving to WiiM. You can probably get a good price for your Sonos gear on Facebook Marketplace or elsewhere, which will help to offset the cost of the new WiiM devices. Just remember that if Apple AirPlay matters, you’ll need to select your WiiM products carefully.\nFinally, if you’re new to streaming and wireless multi-room, you owe it to yourself to check out WiiM before jumping on the Sonos train. Existing hi-fi owners will love WiiM’s expansive technical feature set and its ease of use. Those just starting to assemble a home audio system will appreciate WiiM’s lower cost of entry, making it an attractive alternative to Sonos.\nWiiM’s device lineup is tiny compared to Sonos', but my gut tells me it won’t stay this way for long. The WiiM Sub Pro is here, the WiiM Sound is almost here, and it doesn’t take a crystal ball to predict that the company will eventually mirror Sonos’ entire lineup.\nThe best Sonos Roam 2 deals today\n$174.99\nView\n$179\nView\n$419.99\nView\nShow more\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\nThe best Sonos Era 300 deals today\n$449\n$359\nView\n$449\nView\n$449\nView\nShow more\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\nTOPICS\nSonos\nSimon Cohen\nSimon covers all things audio/video, whether it's reviewing the latest wireless earbuds, or explaining tech terms like spatial audio and PHOLED in language anyone can understand.\nHe has been covering technology for nearly 20 years; first as the editor of Canada's most visited Science and Technology hub on Sympatico/MSN, then later as a freelance journalist with bylines at Digital Trends, Ozy.com, Mobilesyrup, Driving.ca and VentureBeat.

    "summary": "This article compares Sonos and WiiM multi-room audio ecosystems, prompted by Sonos's controversial 2024 software redesign that eroded user trust. While Sonos offers a comprehensive hardware ecosystem, its software has become less intuitive. WiiM, a smaller brand, is gaining traction with an app reminiscent of older Sonos versions and more affordable hardware, though its device lineup is currently smaller. WiiM excels in advanced audio settings, supporting higher resolutions and offering more EQ options than Sonos. The article advises long-time Sonos users with extensive setups to stay, but suggests those with simpler Sonos systems or new users consider WiiM, especially if Apple AirPlay is a priority (as some WiiM devices lack it). WiiM is expected to expand its hardware offerings to compete more directly with Sonos.",

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is done with Google, and Google won’t be happy with the result. On Friday, the court completely denied its petition to have its\nEpic v. Google\ncase re-heard — and pressed play\non a permanent injunction\nthat will force Google to begin cracking open its Android app store.\nUnless or until the US Supreme Court decides to hear the case, Google will be forced to let developers bypass its Google Play Billing app store payment system, and let them link to outside app store downloads, within 30 days. And that’s just the start. Google will also be\nforced to carry rival app stores inside the Google Play Store and share its full catalog of apps\nwith those stores by summer 2026 unless the Supreme Court grants a stay.\nEpic already won its case at the Ninth Circuit\non July 31st,\nwhen a three-judge panel decided not to overturn\nthe unanimous jury verdict from 2023\nthat Google’s app store and payment systems had become illegal monopolies. But Google argued that the Supreme Court might see things differently, and asked for what’s called an “en banc” review where the whole Ninth Circuit weighs in.\nRelated\nEpic just won its Google lawsuit again, and Android may never be the same\nEpic v. Google: everything we’re learning in Fortnite court\nBut not a single additional Ninth Circuit judge wanted to re-hear the case, the court wrote on Friday, denying Google’s petition. And with that, the Ninth Circuit also restarted the clock on\nforcefully cracking open Android\n, giving the company a new deadline of just 30 days to begin complying, and 10 months until Google must open up its app store to rivals. That’s up from 14 days and 8 months previously.\nSo, what must Google do by October? Here’s the TL;DR:\nStop Google from forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing\nLet Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store\nLet Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store\nLet developers set their own prices\nStop sharing money or perks with phonemakers, carriers, and app developers in exchange for Google Play exclusivity or preinstallation\nWork with Epic to resolve any disputes as Google builds a system to let rival app stores in\nDon’t take my word for it; here’s the full text directly out of Judge Donato’s original permanent injunction for the parts that now have a 30-day deadline:\n4. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not share revenue generated by the Google Play Store with any person or entity that distributes Android apps, or has stated that it will launch or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store.\n5. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement by an app developer to launch an app first or exclusively in the Google Play Store.\n6. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement by an app developer not to launch on a third-party Android app distribution platform or store a version of an app that includes features not available in, or is otherwise different from, the version of the app offered on the Google Play Store.\n7. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or carrier to preinstall the Google Play Store on any specific location on an Android device.\n9. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not require the use of Google Play Billing in apps distributed on the Google Play Store, or prohibit the use of in-app payment methods other than Google Play Billing. Google may not prohibit a developer from communicating with users about the availability of a payment method other than Google Play Billing. Google may not require a developer to set a price based on whether Google Play Billing is used.\n10. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not prohibit a developer from communicating with users about the availability or pricing of an app outside the Google Play Store, and may not prohibit a developer from providing a link to download the app outside the Google Play Store.\n13. Within thirty days of the date of this order, the parties will recommend to the Court a three-person Technical Committee. Epic and Google will each select one member of the Technical Committee, and those two members will select the third member. After appointment by the Court, the Technical Committee will review disputes or issues relating to the technology and processes required by the preceding provisions. If the Technical Committee cannot resolve a dispute or issue, a party may ask the Court for a resolution. The Technical Committee may not extend any deadline set in this order, but may recommend that the Court accept or deny a request to extend. Each party will bear the cost of compensating their respective party-designated committee member for their work on the committee. The third member’s fees will be paid by the parties in equal share.\nWe have asked Google to confirm or deny whether it will remove the requirement for Google Play Billing, allow other payment methods, and let developers link outside the Play Store by October. I’ve also asked both Epic and Google to confirm whether they’re now working together on that joint Technical Committee. Neither company immediately responded to our requests for comment.\nSo far, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney\nhas tweeted:\n“Now Google Play has 30 days to free ALL DEVELOPERS to offer competing payments in the USA — as Apple is required to do — free of scare screens, junk fees, and restrictions!” and “With super strong precedent in Epic v Apple, there’s no room for malicious compliance this time.” He\nalso suggested\nthat Epic doesn’t oppose\nGoogle’s new Android developer verification requirements\nin principle, but “we do oppose any use of such verification processes to block, stifle, or tax competing stores.”\nGoogle has not yet said whether it will appeal to the Supreme Court, and we’ve asked about that as well. According to the Ninth Circuit, Google said that if it did appeal, it would do so within 45 days.\nHere’s the Ninth Circuit’s latest decision:\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nSean Hollister\nClose\nSean Hollister\nSenior Editor\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nSean Hollister\nAndroid\nClose\nAndroid\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAndroid\nGaming\nClose\nGaming\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGaming\nGoogle\nClose\nGoogle\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGoogle\nMobile\nClose\nMobile\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nMobile\nNews\nClose\nNews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nNews\nPC Gaming\nClose\nPC Gaming\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and the homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPC Gaming\nPolicy\nClose\nPolicy\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPolicy\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMore in this stream\nSee all\nGoogle isn’t petitioning the Supreme Court yet — it’s appealing Epic again to the appeals court first.\nSean Hollister\nAug 15\nEpic says Fortnite is coming back to iOS in Australia\nSean Hollister\nand\nJess Weatherbed\nAug 12\nGoogle just got a minimum one-week emergency stay before it has to change Android app store policy.\nSean Hollister\nAug 1\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kind\nSpotify Lossless is an inconvenient improvement\nMicrosoft\tis changing how\nXbox\ncontrollers work on Windows 11\nAirPods Pro 3 review: tripling down on a good thing\nYour iPhone is about to look way different\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

    "source": "Social media\nWhat to expect at Meta Connect 2025: 'Hypernova' smart glasses, AI and the metaverse\nMeta's smart glasses with a display are expected to go on sale later this year.\nKarissa Bell\nSenior Editor\nKarissa Bell\nSenior Editor\nUpdated\nMon, September 15, 2025 at 8:07 PM UTC\n6 min read\nASSOCIATED PRESS\nMeta Connect, the company's annual event dedicated to all things AR, VR, AI and the metaverse is just days away. And once again, it seems like it will be a big year for smart glasses and AI.\nThis year, the event will take a slightly different format than in the past. Mark Zuckerberg is\nscheduled\nto kick things off with an evening keynote at 5PM PT on Wednesday, September 17. A developer keynote with other executives will take place the next morning on September 18, beginning at 10AM, with more talks and developer sessions to follow.\nIt's not clear why Meta changed things up this year, but it is shaping up to be a particularly eventful year for Connect. We're expecting two new models of smart glasses, including Meta's first to have a display, as well as new Meta AI and metaverse updates. As usual, Engadget will be reporting live from Zuckerberg's keynote at Meta HQ, but until then, here's a closer look at what's coming and what to keep an eye on.\nNew and updated smart glasses\nThe biggest news of the day will be Meta's next-generation of smart glasses. The frames, often referred to by their reported internal name \"\nHypernova\n,\" will be the first consumer-ready glasses from Meta that have a display. We already know quite a bit about these thanks to more than a year of leaks.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWhile the frames are expected to have a small display on one side, they won't offer the kind of immersive augmented reality experience we've seen on Meta's\nOrion prototype\n. Instead the display will allow you to view things like notifications and photo previews. The glasses will also come with a dedicated wristband, similar to what the company showed off with Orion, that allows the wearer to control specific features through hand gestures.\nThe EMG wristband that's part of the Orion prototype.\n(Karissa Bell for Engadget)\nThe glasses, which are expected to go on sale later this year, will likely cost around $800, according\nto reports\n. And while there was previously some suggestion the glasses may be sold under a different EssilorLuxottica brand, it now seems they will indeed be Ray-Ban branded. On Monday, just days ahead of Connect, a promotional video for \"Meta Ray-Ban Display\" glasses\nsurfaced online\n. The video showed glasses with clear frames, a heads-up display and a wristband.\nThe video doesn't show a price, but given the likely higher price tag — most of Meta's other Ray-Ban-branded glasses cost around $300 — it seems the company is positioning this as a higher-end product that will have a more limited appeal. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has\nsuggested\nHypernova will have a \"negligible\" share of the overall smart glasses market.\nThe video also seemingly confirms a new version of Oakley sunglasses, based on the brand's Sphaera glasses. It shows a pair of the familiar wraparound frames with a single camera in the center near the nose. Those glasses, which have been previously reported, aren't expected to have a display. Previous leaks have also hinted at new versions of non-display Ray-Ban glasses too, with\nleaked renders\nshowing a pair of sunglasses and a version with clear frames.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nEssilorLuxottica's Chief Wearables Officer, Rocco Basilico, has also teased that it will be an \"extra special\" year at Connect. In\na post\non Threads tagging Meta, he wrote that he was \"proud to share what we’ve built together.\"\nWe could also see new third-party glasses integrations. As\nUploadVR\nrecently\npointed out,\nearly versions of the Connect schedule for developers seemingly confirms that Meta is getting ready to give developers access to its smart glasses. Up to now, the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley glasses have mostly been limited to apps within Meta's ecosystem (with a few exceptions like Spotify and Audible). Allowing more developers to start experimenting with the platform could bring even more functionality to the existing lineup of glasses.\nMeta AI\nAs with other recent years, AI will be a major theme throughout. Meta AI has\na billion\nmonthly users (something Zuckerberg will surely remind us of) and I'm expecting to see new features for Meta AI both on the company's glasses and within its apps.\nBusiness Insider\nreports\nthe company has been working on new lineup of non-English speaking \"character-driven\" bots for its apps. (Meta's character-centric chatbots have also faced scrutiny, with the company\nrecently blocking\nteens' access to many user-generated characters amid growing safety concerns.)\nOutside of Meta's chatbots, I'm hoping Zuckerberg will talk more about his vision to create \"superintelligence.\" As I wrote in July, his\ninitial manifesto\nthat outlined his vision was confusing at best. The CEO has recently reorganized Meta's AI teams around the idea, and has been on a very expensive\nhiring spree\nto recruit executives and researchers for the effort.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, Zuckerberg could use Connect to shore up expectations around its Llama models. The company's larger Llama 4 model has\nbeen delayed\nand reports suggest Meta's engineers have been struggling to improve it. There are other signs that Zuckerberg may be\nbacking away\nfrom open-source AI.\nWhat about the metaverse?\nWhile the metaverse has taken somewhat of a backseat to AI in recent years, it wouldn't be Connect without some VR-related news. In a recent Instagram post, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth teased \"metaverse software\" updates related to Horizon Worlds at Connect. The company recently offered\na preview\nto developers of its plan to bring AI-powered NPCs to the metaverse, and I expect we'll hear more about how generative AI could help shape the metaverse.\nAnd while there are no new Quest headsets expected, we could hear more about those third-party VR headsets that will run Meta's VR software. Last year, the company announced that\nASUS, Lenovo and Xbox\nwere working on Meta Horizon OS headsets. We haven't heard too much about these devices since, but there was\na leak earlier\nthis year that suggested ASUS would be the first to launch, and that it would include face and eye tracking features.\nAnother intriguing possibility is an update on Meta's holographic Codec avatars we got\na glimpse\nof last year. While Meta's current lineup of VR headsets don't have the necessary face and eye-tracking sensors to support the tech,\nUploadVR\nsuggests\nMeta could show off a more \"rudimentary\" version of the avatars that could run on the Quest 3 or even work in conjunction with video calls on WhatsApp and Messenger.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nUpdate, September 16, 2025, 11:30AM PT:\nThis post has been updated to reflect a Threads post from EssilorLuxottica's Chief Wearables Officer.\nUpdate, September 16, 2025, 1:07PM PT:\nAdded details from a video showing \"Meta Ray-Ban Display\" and a new pair of Oakey sunglasses.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",

    "topic": "Tesla is redesigning its door handles following safety probe, Bloomberg investigation",
    "source": "Tesla is “working on” redesigning its door handles so they are less likely to trap people inside the company’s cars, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen\ntold Bloomberg News\non Wednesday.\nThe news comes just one day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an probe into Tesla’s door handles, and one week after a Bloomberg News investigation highlighted multiple instances where owners or passengers were stuck in their cars following a crash.\nVon Holzhausen didn’t specify when Tesla made the decision to rethink how its door handles work, according to Bloomberg. China has already been pushing automakers to reconsider the use of fully concealed door handles because of safety concerns, although the country’s top regulator has not taken a final action.\nOne of the two apparent problems with Tesla’s door handles has been they use electronic locks, which can stop working if they aren’t receiving power from the car’s battery system. The other is that, while Tesla does have manual door releases built into its cars, they are often hard to find and difficult to access.\n“The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” von Holzhausen told Bloomberg. “That’s something that we’re working on.”\nNHTSA opened its investigation on Tuesday after the agency said it had received nine complaints from Tesla owners who experienced a failure with their door handles. In four of those cases, the safety agency said the owners had to break a window “to regain entry into the vehicle.”\nTesla includes instructions in its owner’s manuals that describe how to use an outside power source to activate dead electronic door locks, as both NHTSA and Bloomberg have noted.

    "summary": "Tesla is “working on” redesigning its door handles so they are less likely to trap people inside the company’s cars, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen\ntold Bloomberg News\non Wednesday.\nThe news comes just one day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an probe into Tesla’s door handles, and one week after a Bloomberg News investigation highlighted multiple instances where owners or passengers were stuck in their cars following a crash.\nVon Holzhausen didn’t specify when Tesla made the decision to rethink how its door handles work, according to Bloomberg. China has already been pushing automakers to reconsider the use of fully concealed door handles because of safety concerns, although the country’s top regulator has not taken a final action.\nOne of the two apparent problems with Tesla’s door handles has been they use electronic locks, which can stop working if they aren’t receiving power from the car’s battery system. The other is that, while Tesla does have manual door releases built into its cars, they are often hard to find and difficult to access.\n“The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” von Holzhausen told Bloomberg. “That’s something that we’re working on.”\nNHTSA opened its investigation on Tuesday after the agency said it had received nine complaints from Tesla owners who experienced a failure with their door handles. In four of those cases, the safety agency said the owners had to break a window “to regain entry into the vehicle.”\nTesla includes instructions in its owner’s manuals that describe how to use an outside power source to activate dead electronic door locks, as both NHTSA and Bloomberg have noted. But NHTSA noted in its preliminary report that none of the owners who contacted the agency reported seeing low-voltage battery warnings — meaning they likely would not have known what was causing the problem.",

SSA does not have a private cloud within its secure AWS,\" he wrote.\nBisignano wrote that \"all employees are required to go through a vetting process prior to being granted access to SSA information systems\" and \"are granted the appropriate permissions to perform their work\" based on their job functions. He said the agency's \"AWS cloud environment is audited yearly to ensure these controls are implemented and maintained.\"\nWe contacted Borges' attorneys at the Government Accountability Project today and will update this article if we get a response.\nBorges resigned “involuntarily”\nBorges' whistleblower report alleged that SSA officials violated the Federal Information Security Modernization Act by \"knowingly placing a High-Value Asset containing data on over 450 million people in an uncontrolled environment.\" The Government Accountability Project said that if \"bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital healthcare and food benefits, and the government may be responsible for re-issuing every American a new Social Security Number at great cost.\"\nBorges resigned from the SSA a few days after going public with his allegations. In a\nletter\nto Bisignano, Borges said he was \"involuntarily\" leaving his position.\n\"This involuntary resignation is the result of SSA's actions against me, which make my duties impossible to perform legally and ethically, have caused me serious attendant mental, physical, and emotional distress, and constitute a constructive discharge,\" he wrote. \"After reporting internally to management and externally to regulators serious data security and integrity concerns impacting our citizens' most sensitive personal data, I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable.\"\nBorges' resignation letter alleged that \"newly installed leadership in IT and executive offices created a culture of panic and dread, with minimal information sharing, frequent discussions on employee termination, and general organizational dysfunction. Executives and employees are afraid to share information or concerns on questionable activities for fear of retribution or termination, and repeated requests by me for visibility into these events have been rebuffed or ignored by agency leadership, with some employees directed not to reply to my queries.\"\nBisignano probably isn't done answering questions about the whistleblower allegations.

    "source": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe AKG N9 (also called the AKG N9 'Hybrid' by the company) are some of the most feature-packed headphones I’ve ever tested. They have a range of ANC modes, useful on-cup touch controls and an included USB-C dongle to instantly get high-res audio from a new device. They also sound great and look fantastic, although a high price and sadly-inflexible design may put off some buyers.\nCheck Amazon\nCheck Walmart\nPros\n+\nGreat audio\n+\nConnectivity dongle\n+\nHandy cup controls\nCons\n-\nHigh price in the market\n-\nInflexible design\n-\nANC could be better\nBest picks for you\nThe best wireless headphones for 2025\nThe best noise cancelling headphones 2025\nThe best headphones 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best.\nFind out more about how we test.\nJump to:\nOne minute review\nSpecifications\nPrice and availability\nDesign\nFeatures\nSound performance\nValue\nScorecard\nShould I buy?\nAlso consider\nHow I tested\nAKG N9: Two minute review\nAs someone who tests headphones for an income, I've got a roster of \"X headphones\" for specific tasks. I've got my\nbest headphones\nfor music, my\nrunning headphones\n, a\ngaming headset\n, a pair of the\nbest earbuds\nwhen it's too hot for headphones, and a set-up for movies and TV shows too.\nThe new AKG N9 from\nSamsung\n's sub-brand's sub-brand, AKG, didn't slot into this line-up as much as they replaced half of them, and it's largely down to one handy feature which we also saw in their contemporary earbuds equivalent, the AKG N5.\nI'm not going to do that clickbait headline thing of alluding to a feature and then dancing around the topic, only specifying it 20 paragraphs in: this feature is a dongle which comes build into the AKG N9, and if you plug it into any USB-C slot, it overrides that device's audio output into the N9.\nBorrowing a partner's laptop for a quick video call? Dongle it. Don't want to play games out loud for fear of annoying a flatmate? Dongle it. Really can't be bothered to set up Bluetooth on every device you own? Dongle it. That's not to mention that this dongle has a higher quality connection than Bluetooth, affording higher-quality music and entertainment.\nWithin days of me realising the potential of this dongle, I'd begun using the N9 for a range of tasks that I usually afford to bespoke speakers or headphones; I was watching movies from my iPad, playing video games on my PC and taking calls on my girlfriend's tablet. And now you can take a break from reading the word 'dongle' for a bit.\nA handy way to instantly and temporarily connect to any device is a killer feature, but it's not the only one the AKG N9 offer. The AKG Headphones app is full of extras like dynamic EQ, spatial audio, L-R panning and a hearing test to create you a bespoke audio profile.\nThere's also a battery life that stretches up to a staggering 100 hours if you listen on Bluetooth with noise cancellation off, but lasts for over a day even if you turn on all its power-hungry features.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nOf course, I wouldn't be commending headphones like these if they sounded bad; they don't, with AKG's staple neutral audio mix delivering detailed music and an expansive sound stage.\nI'm not used to writing so many positives in an introduction, so it feels weird to\nkeep going\n, but one more thing: the AKG N9 are some of the best-designed headphones I've ever tested. Not only do they look premium but lots of the features are smartly incorporated into the design, with the dongle nestled in a little nook in one cup and volume being controlled by easily twisting one side of the cans. AKG clearly treats design as an important part of the headphone-making process, instead of an afterthought to hold a few drivers and buttons together, and it's appreciated.\nUnless you're Sir Mix-a-Lot, you probably don't like big \"but...\"s, and unfortunately the AKG N9 have a major one: the price. There's no two ways about it: these are premium headphones and many buyers' budgets won't come close to reaching them. That said, they're\nexpensive\n, but they're not four-figure-cost expensive like many of the true best headphones are, so perhaps sales will bring them within reach if you're interested.\nSince I have to list three 'cons': I also feel like the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) could have been a little bit more robust, as it doesn't compare with top dogs on the market right now. Plus, you can't fold up the headphones for increased portability, which made transporting them in my bag a risky proposition.AK\nAKG N9 review: Specifications\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\nComponent\nValue\nWater resistant\nNA\nBattery life (quoted)\n100 hours (ANC off) 55 hours (ANC on)\nBluetooth type\nBluetooth 5.3\nWeight\n281g\nDriver\n40mm\nAKG N9 review: Price and availability\n(Image credit: Future)\nAnnounced in October 2024\nPriced at $399 / £299 / AU$499\nExpensive... but competitive to rivals\nAfter making their debut in October 2024, the AKG N9 went on sale that same month. They’ve been on sale for roughly a year, by the time of this review.\nThe AKG N9 don’t come cheap. They’ll set you back $399 / £299 / AU$499, which firmly cements them as premium cans that you need to consider carefully before you buy.\nThey cost more than some of our favorite rivals including the iconic\nSony WH-1000XM4\nand\nCambridge Audio Melomania P100\n, but then again, they undercut (to a decent extent) the\nB&W Px8,\nDali IO-8\n, the\nSony WH-1000XM6\nand\nBose QuietComfort Ultra\n.\nI should point out that a year on shelves seemingly hasn’t affected the headphones’ usual price (outside of sales)... except in Australia, where they were easy to find for as little as AU$309 which is an absolute steal.\nAKG N9 review: Design\n(Image credit: Future)\nPremium-looking sleek cans\nFeatures incorporated into design\nDoesn't fold down and no IP rating\nOn the surface, the AKG N9 might look like any old pair of headphones, but there are a few refinements and polishes that go a long way in making these look both premium and feel ultra-functional.\nI’m talking about the soft fabric of the headband (either leather or a close imitator), the comfortable earpads, the sparkling sheen of the speaker covers, svelte fashion of the headband connectors. It all comes together to make it obvious to onlookers just how much you paid for these cans. They come in either white or black.\nThe headphones weigh 281g so despite some\noption extras that we’ll get to\n, they’re on the lighter side of things, and I found them comfortable to wear for long music bouts and entire movies. There’s no IP rating, as far as I can tell, but they felt sturdy enough that I wasn’t worried wearing them out and about.\nI also had no qualms in wearing them for long periods of time, as they're comfortable and lightweight.\nEvidence of how easily-bendable the hook is.\n(Image credit: Future)\nThe headband connectors are extendable by about two inches each, letting you change your headphones’ size. One thing to note is that the headband can’t be folded, so you can’t reduce the size of the N9 to fit in a bag. Instead they can be transported in a rather large carry case that comes included in the price.\nAs with all the\nbest headphones\n, each cup provides some useful controls. On the right side we’ve got a slider which lets you turn on the headphones as well as put them into Bluetooth pairing mode, as well as a pause/play button and USB-C charging port – and, in one of my favorite implementations of a volume rocker, the entire headphone cover can be rotated clockwise or anticlockwise to change the volume. This was incredibly easy to use, to save me fiddling with small buttons on the headphone.\nThe left cup has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a toggle for Ambient Aware noise cancellation, and I thought that was it at the beginning of my testing… until I realized that you can partially slide the headphone cover off to reveal a USB-C dongle underneath. Some may be annoyed that they’re carrying the extra weight of this dongle on the head but it’s only a few grams, and these are still nice and lightweight headphones.\nDesign score: 4.5/5\nAKG N9 review: Features\n(Image credit: Future)\nHugely long battery life\nApp brings loads of features\nUseful dongle connector\nThe dongle is one of my favorite features of the AKG N9; you can plug it into any device with a USB-C port to instantly (and, vitally, temporarily) connect to said device without having to go through the laborious pairing method.\nI used this to connect to my iPad, my laptop and my PC at various times in order to quickly watch a video, take a call or do some work, and it’s incredibly convenient – in fact, for a while during testing the N9 became my go-to gaming headset. One thing to note is that once during testing the connected device still played music out of its speakers instead of using the N9, and I never really worked out why – like the N5, it worked 90% of the time, but there were a few teething problems.\nAnother thing I absolutely love is the battery life of the AKG N9, which if you play your cards right lasts for an entire 100 hours. ‘Playing your cards right’ involves listening via Bluetooth with ANC turned off and if you want ANC on, that figure drops by 45 hours; likewise using the dongle cuts about 15% of your listening time over Bluetooth.\n(Image credit: Future)\nHowever AKG’s\nlowest\nbattery expectation, specifically talk time over the dongle, is still 30 hours, which beats quite a few competitors. So the battery life is great whatever you do, and it’s fantastic that people who need a lot of listening time on one charge have the option of dialling down the features to get that fantastic figure.\nLet’s touch on that active noise cancellation, which so dramatically affects the battery life. AKG has given the N9 a range of ANC modes: Ambient Aware which cuts out ambient background sound but allows in important nearby ones, TalkThru which does the same but just for voices, and a standard ANC mode which has extra modes for Adaptive ANC which changes the noise cancellation strength depending on your surroundings and Auto Compensation which does the same based on how you’re wearing the N9.\nIt’s a pretty overwhelming array of options for non-audiophiles but it does let you get into the nitty-gritty of what you can and can’t hear. However even at its strongest tier the ANC is only good, never great, and quite a few rivals are better for removing background sound.\nThose aren’t the only overwhelming options in the feature set, because the AKG Headphones App has an absolutely huge roster of perks, including the ability to balance your sound to the left or right, change how voices sound on calls and play with a 10-band equalizer.\nAs in the AKG N5, the app lets you choose between listening to high-res audio,\nor\nenabling a few other features including spatial audio, dynamic EQ for low volumes and Personi-Fi. This latter is a hearing test that provides you with a custom audio mix.\nFeatures score: 5/5\nAKG N9 review: Sound performance\n(Image credit: Future)\n40mm drivers\nBalanced sound profile\nTextured audio in high-res mode\nThe AKG N9 pack 40mm dynamic drivers with what the company calls “liquid crystal polymer diaphragms” which are designed to improve the detail and clarity across the board.\nIt works because the N9 have a beautifully balanced sound profile, which doesn’t dominate your mix with too much treble or overblown bass (though it also gives you a nice springboard to use the equalizer to change this if you\nlike\na wonky sound mix).\nInstead you’re getting a detailed glimpse across the bow of an entire orchestra or band, full of texture and detail. You can hear the scoop of a bass guitar string, the strike of fingers on piano keys – I almost felt like I could tell which guitar strings were being strummed during chords.\nThere’s an audible sound spread too, and I noticed mids in several songs holding a distinct space that many rival cans lose. It’s an effect that makes these just as great for movies and gaming as for music, and I went so far as to use these headphones instead of my gaming headset during the testing period.\nAt times I did feel like songs lacked a an extra ounce of energy, with the bass in particular missing a touch of momentum, but these aren’t huge issues – I’m only nit-picking here to justify the score below not being a full 5 out of 5.\nSound performance score: 4/5\nAKG N9: Value\n(Image credit: Future)\nIf you’ve read the price section already, you’ll know that the AKG N9 have an uphill battle in proving themselves in the value department (and if you didn’t read that section, they cost $399 / £299 / AU$499).\nBasically no headphones costing that much present a real value proposition, not when you can get great alternatives for a third of the price, but for what it’s worth the AKG N9s come closer than most.\nThe inclusion of the dongle, the useful cup controls, the range of features and high-quality audio all come together to make it clear that AKG is giving you some value for money… just not as much as if you’d paid a lot less money.\nI will say, though, that these are primed for deals in Black Friday and\nAmazon\nPrime Days. So if you don't\nthink\nyou can afford them, it could be waiting to see how low the price goes.\nValue score: 4/5\nAKG N9 review: scorecard\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\nCategory\nComment\nScore\nValue\nAKG goes some way in justifing the price of the N9, but they're easily beaten in this department.\n4/5\nDesign\nNot only do the cans look great, but the design neatly incorporates many of the headphone's features.\n4.5/5\nFeatures\nFrom the Bluetooth dongle to the range of app features to the long-lasting battery, everything's working here.\n5/5\nSound\nThe N9 has a nice balanced sound profile that will please most listeners, if not owners of the real top dogs.\n4/5\nAKG N9: Should I buy?\n(Image credit: Future)\nBuy them if...\nYou own mulitple smart devices\nThe AKG N9 are primed for people who want to connect their headphones to multiple devices like laptops, phones, computers (even games consoles or PCs).\nYou don't get to charge frequently\nThe 100-hour battery life is really impressive. Even though most users will turn on ANC or use the dongle and not see that figure, it's great to know that it's an option for travellers or forgetful chargers.\nYou need a carry case\nCertainly not all headphones come with a carry case, but the AKG N9 does, which is great for transporting it. Not only that but the case has sections for various cables and an extra adaptor to connect the N9 to airline entertainment systems.\nDon't buy them if...\nYou can't justify the price\nThere's no shame in admitting that these headphones are too expensive for everyone to consider buying. Even if you can reach for them, if you don't need the feature set, cheaper models are tempting rivals.\nYou want foldable or waterproof cans\nNo IP rating and no way of folding the AKG N9 down does hamper their portability and protection somewhat.\nAlso consider\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\nComponent\nAKG N9\nCambridge Audio Melomania P100\nSony WH-1000XM6\nWater resistant\nNA\nNA\nNA\nBattery life\n100 hours (ANC off) 55 hours (ANC on)\n100 hours (ANC off) 60 hours (ANC on)\n40 hours (ANC off) 30 hours (ANC on)\nBluetooth type\nBluetooth 5.3\nBluetooth 5.3\nBluetooth 5.3\nWeight\n281g\n330g\n254g\nDriver\n40mm\n40mm\n30mm dynamic\nCambridge Audio Melomania P100\nWe gave the P100 five stars in our review due to just how amazing they sound and how premium they feel.

    "source": "Smart home\nSoftware update shoves ads onto Samsung’s pricey fridges\nSamsung's \"pilot program\" is likely just the beginning.\nScharon Harding\n–\nSep 18, 2025 1:32 pm\n|\n174\nA fridge from Samsung's AI Family Hub+ series.\nCredit:\nSamsung\nA fridge from Samsung's AI Family Hub+ series.\nCredit:\nSamsung\nText\n        settings\nStory text\nSize\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\n*\nStandard\nWide\nLinks\nStandard\nOrange\n* Subscribers only\nLearn more\nMinimize to nav\nDays after someone revealed the news on social media, Samsung confirmed today that it is showing advertisements on some US customers’ smart fridges. Samsung said the ads showing on some Family Hub-series fridges are part of a pilot program, but we suspect that they may become more permanent additions to Samsung fridges and/or other types of screen-equipped smart home appliances.\nIn a statement sent to Ars Technica, Samsung confirmed that it is “conducting a pilot program to offer promotions and curated advertisements on certain Samsung Family Hub refrigerator models in the US market.”\nSamsung currently lists nine Family Hub refrigerators in the US, which have MSRPs ranging\nfrom $1,800 to $3,500\n. Family Hub fridges have 21.5- or 32-inch screens, which, until now, users have had autonomy over for displaying helpful or fun things, like photos and videos, memos, weather, timers, and a web browser. Some of those abilities require a Wi-Fi connection or a Samsung account.\nNow, Samsung is commandeering some of the screens already set up in homes to display ads. As Samsung’s rep explained:\nAs a part of this pilot program, Family Hub refrigerators in the US will receive an over-the-network (OTN) software update with Terms of Service (T&C) and Privacy Notice (PN). Advertising will appear on certain Family Hub refrigerator Cover Screens. The Cover Screen appears when a Family Hub screen is idle. Ad design format may change depending on Family Hub personalization options for the Cover Screen, and advertising will not appear when Cover Screen displays Art Mode or picture albums.\nIf a user doesn’t like a particular ad, they can remove it so that they won’t see the ad “again during the campaign period,” Samsung’s rep noted.\nSamsung declined to respond to specific questions sent about the pilot program, including which fridge models are affected and its response to customers who may be irked that their expensive appliance is suddenly showing ads.\nSamsung hasn't been particularly forthcoming about the program, which appears to have been publicly disclosed for the first time by a\nReddit user\n, as spotted by\nSamMobile\n.\nA picture that the Redditor posted shows a message purportedly displayed on a Samsung fridge informing owners of the ads, reading: \"To enhance our service and offer additional content to users, advertisements will be displayed on the Cover Screen for the Weather, Color, and Daily Board Themes.”\nA Reddit user shared this notice shown on Samsung fridges.\nCredit:\nangrycatmeowmeow/Reddit\nA Reddit user shared this notice shown on Samsung fridges.\nCredit:\nangrycatmeowmeow/Reddit\nSamsung recently downplayed the idea of using smart appliances' screens for ads. While speaking with\nThe Verge\nin April, Jeong Seung Moon, EVP and head of the R&D team for Samsung Electronics' Digital Appliances Business, said Samsung had “no plans regarding the inclusion of advertisements on AI Home screens.”\nTechnically,\nthe pilot program is running on fridges' larger \"Cover Screens,\" not “AI Home Screens,” which are smaller (7 -or 9-inch) touchscreens that Samsung\nintroduced to appliances in late 2024.\nBut it still feels like Samsung missed numerous opportunities to manage expectations with its rollout of ads on Samsung products.\nYou can see the smaller AI Home Screens on these Samsung appliances.\nCredit:\n                                      Samsung\nYou can see the smaller AI Home Screens on these Samsung appliances.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Samsung\nDespite this, some may have been tipped off to Samsung's potential shift to ads from the company's growing obsession with putting screens on products that are usually controllable with\nmore repairable, affordable, and simpler solutions,\nlike buttons and dials. But there are still bound to be people upset to see their fridge updated to display commercial messaging where their family eats and cooks.\nAnother reason to leave appliances offline\nBased on Samsung’s statement, users can prevent ads from showing on their smart fridges by having the screen show photos or art. However, that limits the ways people can use their expensive fridge.\nAnother option is to disconnect the fridge from the Internet. Again, though, this would eliminate some core capabilities, like its meal planner, recipes, and shopping list features.\nOn the other hand, some Samsung fridge owners may not even notice the update, considering that vendors have\nstruggled to get people to connect home appliances\nto the Internet.\nLess than half\nof the smart appliances that LG had sold were online in 2023, for example.\nSmart appliance makers that would like to access the valuable user data and ad revenue that are available when people connect their appliances to the web battle\nprivacy concerns\n, indifference, and technical limitations. Samsung's reminder to everyone about how easy it is for tech companies to turn people's smart appliances into billboards is another deterrent.\nBut with expensive and large electronics purchases happening infrequently for most households, many tech companies\nare increasingly relying on ads\nfor\nrecurring revenue\n.

Samsung said the ads showing on some Family Hub-series fridges are part of a pilot program, but we suspect that they may become more permanent additions to Samsung fridges and/or other types of screen-equipped smart home appliances.\nIn a statement sent to Ars Technica, Samsung confirmed that it is “conducting a pilot program to offer promotions and curated advertisements on certain Samsung Family Hub refrigerator models in the US market.”\nSamsung currently lists nine Family Hub refrigerators in the US, which have MSRPs ranging\nfrom $1,800 to $3,500\n. Family Hub fridges have 21.5- or 32-inch screens, which, until now, users have had autonomy over for displaying helpful or fun things, like photos and videos, memos, weather, timers, and a web browser. Some of those abilities require a Wi-Fi connection or a Samsung account.\nNow, Samsung is commandeering some of the screens already set up in homes to display ads. As Samsung’s rep explained:\nAs a part of this pilot program, Family Hub refrigerators in the US will receive an over-the-network (OTN) software update with Terms of Service (T&C) and Privacy Notice (PN). Advertising will appear on certain Family Hub refrigerator Cover Screens. The Cover Screen appears when a Family Hub screen is idle.",

Its 50-hour battery life means you’ll barely ever have to charge it too. Sure, it’s more costly than its predecessor was at launch, and you can get better protection against the elements from rivals like the Xtreme 4, but the Kilburn III is still one of the best-sounding (and looking) models in its weight class.\nPros\nExceptional battery life\nClassy amp-inspired design\nHighly effective placement compensation\nCons\nInferior IP rating to Xtreme 4\nNo multi-speaker pairing\nNot as portable as JBL’s speaker\nJBL Xtreme 4\n$267.99\nat Newegg\n$299.95\nat Walmart\n$360.95\nat Crutchfield\n$369.95\nat Best Buy\nThe JBL Xtreme 4 delivers each musical element with clarity and distinction and packs in some nifty features that build on the strengths of its predecessor. It's a rugged, outdoorsy speaker that doesn’t go all out on style, but hits all the right notes when it comes to utility, boasting a great battery life and IP67 dustproof and waterproof rating.\nPros\nUltra-rugged design\nSeriously powerful audio output\nConsiderably lighter than Kilburn III\nCons\nRequires EQ tuning to sound its best\nLower battery life than Kilburn III\nExterior design lacks sex appeal\nI've tested a\nlot\nof Bluetooth speakers during my time here at TechRadar – everything from mini audio companions to colossal boombox-style models. But so far, two of my favorite models sit somewhere in the middle of that – they're portable, yet decently bulky units that are ideal for gatherings, parties, or personal listening.\nThe speakers in question are the\nMarshall Kilburn III\nand the\nJBL Xtreme 4\n. Both of these have blown me away with wonderful sound quality, a high standard of build, and plenty of flashy features.\nBut if you're in the market for one of the\nbest Bluetooth speakers\n, which one of these should you buy? Well, it's not all too easy to pick a winner – but I've tried my hardest to pick my champion. So, let's take a look at what sets these models apart, and ultimately, which model I'd spend my own money on.\nYou may like\nEdifier ES300 vs Sonos Move 2: my testing reveals which Wi-Fi speaker offers substantially better sound\nThe best waterproof speakers for 2025\nUltimate Ears Megaboom 4 review: impressive volume and stamina in a business-as-usual Bluetooth speaker\nMarshall Kilburn III vs JBL Xtreme 4: price and availability\nThe Kilburn III released in May 2025, almost seven years after its predecessor, the\nMarshall Kilburn II\n. With a list price of $379 / £299 / AU$599, it comes in at $80 / £50 / AU$100 more than its predecessor at the point of its launch. But that price does reflect a host of major improvements, including superior waterproofing, playtime, and acoustics. The Kilburn III is available in either Black & Brass or Cream.\nMeanwhile, the JBL Xtreme 4 is a little older, having first released in March 2024. Despite carrying a list price of $379.95 / £329.99 / AU$499.95, you’ll regularly find it for less. After a quick search, I spotted it going for less than $280 / £240 / AU$380. Like the Kilburn III, JBL’s speaker is available in multiple colorways – there’s black, blue, and camo.\nMarshall Kilburn III vs JBL Xtreme 4: specs\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\nHeader Cell - Column 0\nMarshall Kilburn III\nJBL Xtreme 4\nWeight\n6.2 lbs / 2.8kg\n4.63 lbs / 2.1kg\nDimensions\n10.7 x 5.9 x 6.7 inches / 273 x 150 x 169mm\n11.7 x 5.9 x 5.6 inches / 297 x 149 x 141mm\nConnectivity\nBluetooth 5.3, AUX\nBluetooth 5.3\nBattery life\n50 hours\n24 hours (plus up to 6 hours more with Playtime Boost)\nSpeaker drivers\n1 x 30W woofer; 2 x 10W full ranges\n2 x 30W woofers, 2 x 20W tweeters\nWaterproofing\nIP54\nIP67\nMarshall Kilburn III vs JBL Xtreme 4: features\nBoth of these Bluetooth speakers are packed with tons of smart feature goodness. Each have the usual good stuff – multi-point connectivity, fast-pairing, and the ability to charge external devices. But there’s so much more to discover in each model’s respective companion app.\nFor instance, the Kilburn III offers placement compensation, enabling you to optimize the speaker’s sound relative to its position in a room. That’s especially useful if the speaker is close to a wall or corner, say. This is something the Xtreme 4 does not offer, unfortunately.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nAnother thing the Kilburn III has that JBL skips on is a shortcut button. Using the Marshall companion app, you can pick two EQ calibrations to switch between using the speaker’s physical ‘M’ button. This lets you seamlessly switch between the standard tuning and a bass boosted mode, for example.\n(Image credit: Future)\nBut the JBL does have a few tricks up its sleeve too. For example, there’s multi-speaker pairing, which you can access via the Xtreme 4 itself or the JBL Portable app. That’s something the Kilburn III left out. It's also got an option called PlayTime Boost, which extends the speaker’s maximum battery life by six hours, though it does disable EQ settings.\nStill, the Kilburn III does have its own battery-related settings. It’s got preservation settings like an optional maximum charge cap, temperature reduction, and adaptive charging speed. It's also got a replaceable battery – something the Xtreme 4 boasts as well.\nYou may like\nEdifier ES300 vs Sonos Move 2: my testing reveals which Wi-Fi speaker offers substantially better sound\nThe best waterproof speakers for 2025\nUltimate Ears Megaboom 4 review: impressive volume and stamina in a business-as-usual Bluetooth speaker\nIt's worth noting too, that the Kilburn III has a colossal battery life of 50 hours, which considerably outdoes the Xtreme 4’s very respectable 30 hours (with PlayTime Boost on). Both speakers also have Auracast and custom EQ options – but also skip on an inbuilt mic for hands-free calling and USB-C audio passthrough.\nIn spite of that, the Kilburn III does have an AUX port for wired listening – which combined with its placement compensation and superior battery life make it the stronger option features-wise – even though multi-speaker pairing was left out.\n(Image credit: Future)\nMarshall Kilburn III vs JBL Xtreme 4: sound quality\nRight, there wasn’t a lot in it features-wise, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the same can be said in terms of sound quality. That’s because both of these Bluetooth speakers perform very well indeed in the audio department, offering highly tuneable, impactful, and clean sound. And that’s even without any fancy codecs like LDAC or aptX Adaptive.\nEach model is crammed full of tech for an optimized listening experience. I already discussed the Kilburn III’s placement compensation feature, but there’s even more at play here. First of all, there’s dynamic loudness, which automatically adjusts bass, mids, and treble, ensuring that you don’t lose out on subtle details, even at high volumes.\nOn top of that, the Kilburn III makes use of Marshall’s ‘True Stereophonic’ sound, meaning you get a great listening experience from all angles. When using the speaker at our music testing space, I couldn’t detect any discernible blind spot, with full-sounding, expressive audio serviced to every part of the room.\nBut JBL didn’t come to play, it came to compete. As a result, the Xtreme 4 has some smart audio tech of its own – namely AI Sound Boost. Basically, this utilizes an AI algorithm to identify speaker movement and response in real-time, helping the Xtreme 4 to plate up “better and more powerful” sound, and reduce distortion at loud volumes. And during the testing process, I certainly found this to be very effective – there was little to no noticeable distortion, even when I cranked up the loudness real high.\nSomething I do like more about the Kilburn III is its sound signature out of the box. When listening to a track like\nKeep That Groove\nby Vitess, I was treated to heavy, pumping low-end output – though the bass never overwhelmed synths or vocals. But the Xtreme 4 left me wanting a bit in terms of low-end power: the thumping bass of Moloko’s\nI Want You\n, for instance, lacked the raw energy I’d expect from a speaker claiming to offer “next level massive” sound.\n(Image credit: Future)\nWith a bit of tinkering in the JBL Portable app, though, my concerns were soon put to bed. With the right tuning, this thing is capable of seriously mighty, yet expertly balanced audio output. Using Custom EQ,\nBlack Eye\nby Allie X was replicated excellently, with a responsive, emphatic interpretation of the track’s deep, rapid drum machine. Vocals were also given plenty of room to breathe, and crashing percussion never sounded harsh.\nThe Xtreme 4 is more powerful than the Kilburn III, making use of two 30W woofers and two 20W tweeters – as opposed to Marshall’s single 30W woofer and dual 10W full-range drivers. So, if sheer strength is what you’re after, it may well be the better pick. However, I have to say that I would edge the Kilburn III in terms of overall quality.\nI’ve already mentioned its credentials as far as bass is concerned, making it more than capable of ramping up a party atmosphere. But beyond that, it provides a wide, engrossing soundstage and surprisingly strong instrument separation. When listening to\nAre You Gonna Go My Way\nby Lenny Kravitz, intertwining guitars sounded pleasantly forward, while fantastically positioned drums and piercing vocals tied up a head-banging listening experience.\n(Image credit: Future)\nMarshall Kilburn III vs JBL Xtreme 4: design\nThis tightly contested battle remains just that as we tip-toe into the realm of design. But while these speakers have shared a lot of strengths so far, this is where they diverge a bit.\nSee, the Marshall Kilburn III is a marvel in design, but predominantly because of its drop-dead gorgeous construction. I’m a huge fan of its amp-inspired look – a nod to Marshall’s rich history in the music space. Its tactile control knobs, red velvet-adorned handle, and golden details are also stand-out aspects, helping the Kilburn III to surpass its predecessor and, indeed, the JBL Xtreme 4, as far as appearances go.\nBoth is Black & Brass and Cream colorways perfectly complement its retro-style aesthetic too.\n(Image credit: Future)\nMeanwhile, the JBL Xtreme 4 goes in a slightly different direction, focusing on a rough and ready build rather than premium looks. It’s got a real tough feel about it, an outdoorsy style – especially in its camo colorway – but above all, excellent protection against the elements.\nSpecifically, JBL’s speaker is IP67-rated, meaning it’s well-shielded against dust, as well as water. It's so weather-resistant, in fact, that it can survive being submerged in up to a meter of water for 30 minutes. Not bad, eh? Combine that with a floatable build and this thing’s ready to go for pool parties, beach-sided bashes and, well, just about anything.\nThe same can’t quite be said about the Marshall Kilburn III. It’s only IP54-rated, which is a significant upgrade over the IPX2 Kilburn II, but means it can only withstand water splashes, rather than full on immersion. Previously, I quizzed Marshall on this, and it told me that the Kilburn III is intended to be more of an “interior statement piece”, due to models such as the IP67-rated\nMarshall Emberton III\nand\nMarshall Middleton\noccupying the rugged space.\nStill, it's safe to say that the Xtreme 4 is the winner when it comes to durability. It's also lighter and has a shoulder strap, making it more portable overall.\nPersonally, though, I’m not a big fan of how it looks. Its pseudo-cylindrical build and color options don’t grab my attention – especially not compared to the Kilburn III. Still, I think it's only fair to call this category a tie, with each model excelling in their own distinct way.\n(Image credit: Future)\nMarshall Kilburn III vs JBL Xtreme 4: value\nLet’s not beat around the bush. If you’re in the market for a cheap and cheerful Bluetooth speaker, neither of these models are going to cut it – they’re closer to the premium side of things.\nBut in this case, these speakers’ high price\nis\nindicative of high quality. With both models, you’re getting high-calibre audio for parties, outdoor gatherings, or personal listening. On top of that, both speakers have great build quality, plenty of features to have fun with, and plenty of playtime.\n(Image credit: Future)\nNow that the Xtreme 4 is regularly on sale, I’d argue that it's a good value pick. It doesn’t have the battery life or beauty of the Kilburn III, but it’s an awesome option if you’re the outdoorsy type or want a touch more power.\nThe Kilburn III is newer, so sales are few and far between, but honestly, I still think it’s well-priced, especially against rivals like the\nBose SoundLink Max\n. The improvements on its predecessor are seismic, it supplies exemplary sonic performance, and that playtime is out of this world.\nIn the end, each of these offer plenty of bang for your buck. I’d probably give the Kilburn III a slight edge on value, due to its slightly superior audio and luxurious appearance, but there’s a lot to love about JBL’s rugged rival, especially with a price-cut.\n(Image credit: Future)\nMarshall Kilburn III vs JBL Xtreme 4: verdict\nUltimately, I think that both of these speakers remain worthy of my recommendation – but the model you pick will depend on what you need it for.\nIf you’re going to be using your flashy new audio companion outdoors – especially near a body of water – the additional power and durability of the Xtreme 4 could be your best bet.\nMeanwhile, the Kilburn III is a fantastic statement piece, and offers up stunning build quality for the price. If you want a speaker for personal listening or indoor gatherings, I’d give it the edge, for its slightly superior audio performance.\nBut if I could only pick one of these in general, I’d also pick the Kilburn III – it just oozes class. I’m a big fan of its 50 hour battery life and room calibration capabilities – plus it did take the edge overall across our four categories.\nToday's best Marshall Kilburn III Portable Bluetooth Speaker and  JBL Xtreme 4 deals\nMarshall Kilburn III Portable Bluetooth\n$379.99\nView Deal\nSee all prices\nJBL Xtreme 4\n$299.95\nView Deal\nSee all prices\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\nAnyway, what’s your view?

Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.\nAt its Connect keynote on Wednesday, Meta officially\nintroduced the $799.99 Meta Ray-Ban Display\n, also known as Hypernova. The brand’s new, high-end smart glasses feature an in-lens display you can control with wrist-based gestures via the new Meta Neural Band that’s included. The display pairs with your phone and allows you to see everything from text messages and Instagram Reels to maps and more — all without having to pull out your device. They seem like a more fully-realized version of\nGoogle Glass\n, and they’ll be released on September 30th.

The display only shows up in the right lens, and when it’s up, it can show apps in full-color with a 600 by 600 pixel resolution and a 20-degree field of view.\nThe Verge’s\nVictoria Song briefly went hands-on with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, and she says the monocular design can be a little distracting, though it doesn’t fully obstruct your vision.\nThe Ray-Ban Display frames are thicker than the current Ray-Ban Meta, with edges that are more rounded and an overall shape that’s more square. They also feature overextension hinges on the temple arms, making them a better fit on wide faces. Meta estimates about six hours of battery life with “mixed use,” though we’ll put that claim to the test when we get a unit to review.\nPhoto: Colt Bradley for The Verge\nMeta also announced the follow-up to the popular Meta Ray-Ban glasses, the\nRay-Ban Meta Gen 2\n, which you can order today from\nMeta\n,\nBest Buy\n, and\nRay-Ban\nstarting at $379. The company claims that its updated smart glasses will deliver up to eight hours of battery life on a single charge, which is twice the four-hour battery life of the previous generation. The charging case, meanwhile, can recharge the glasses up to 50 percent in 20 minutes, and can provide an additional 48 hours of battery life.

Researchers from multiple security firms largely agree that Turla was behind breaches of\nthe\nUS Department of Defense in 2008\n, and more recently, the\nGerman Foreign Office\nand France's military. The group has also been known for\nunleashing stealthy Linux malware\nand using\nsatellite-based Internet links\nto maintain the stealth of its operations\n. The group conducts narrowly targeted attacks on high-value targets and keeps a low profile.\nGamaredon, meanwhile, is a separate APT known for conducting much wider-scale operations, often targeting organizations in Ukraine. Whereas Turla takes pains to fly under the radar, Gamaredon doesn’t seem to care about being detected and linked to the Russian government. Its malware generally aims to collect as much information from targets as possible over a short period of time. Both Turla and Gamaredon are widely assessed to be units of Russia’s Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the country’s chief security agency and successor of the Soviet Union’s KGB.\nHostile takeover possible, collaboration more likely\nSecurity firm ESET\nsaid Friday\nthat it has spotted both groups’ malware being installed alongside each other or interoperating on multiple devices in recent months. Company researchers said it’s possible Turla may have hijacked Gamaredon’s infrastructure in a manner similar to a 2019 event in which the group conducted a\nhostile takeover\nof an attack platform belonging to a competing APT working for Iran’s government. Similarly, Turla\nlast year\nappropriated the infrastructure of two financially motivated hack groups in a campaign targeting Starlink-connected devices in Ukraine.\nBut ESET said its most likely hypothesis is that Turla and Gamaredon were working together. “Given that both groups are part of the Russian FSB (though in two different Centers), Gamaredon provided access to Turla operators so that they could issue commands on a specific machine to restart Kazuar, and deploy Kazuar v2 on some others,” the company said.\nFriday’s post noted that Gamaredon has been seen collaborating with other hack groups previously, specifically\nin 2020\nwith a group ESET tracks under the name InvisiMole.\nIn February, ESET said, company researchers spotted four distinct Gamaredon-Turla co-compromises in Ukraine. On all of the machines, Gamaredon deployed a wide range of tools, including those tracked under the names PteroLNK, PteroStew, PteroOdd, PteroEffigy, and PteroGraphin. Turla, for its part, installed version 3 of its proprietary malware Kazuar.\nESET software installed on one of the compromised devices observed Turla issuing commands through the Gamaredon implants.\n“PteroGraphin was used to restart Kazuar, possibly after Kazuar crashed or was not launched automatically,” ESET said. “Thus, PteroGraphin was probably used as a recovery method by Turla. This is the first time that we have been able to link these two groups together via technical indicators (see First chain:\nFirst chain: Restart of Kazuar v3\n).”\nThen, in April and again in June, ESET said it detected Kazuar v2 installers being deployed by Gamaredon malware. In all the cases, ESET software was installed after the compromises, so it wasn’t possible to recover the payloads. Nonetheless, the firm said it believes an active collaboration between the groups is the most likely explanation.\n“All those elements, and the fact that Gamaredon is compromising hundreds if not thousands of machines, suggest that Turla is interested only in specific machines, probably ones containing highly sensitive intelligence,” ESET speculated.\nDan Goodin\nSenior Security Editor\nDan Goodin\nSenior Security Editor\nDan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he oversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking, encryption, and passwords.

Over ten hours or so,\nClaws of Awaji\nfinally gives Shinobi protagonist Naoe a proper ending, and it’s an essential experience for those looking to finish off Assassin's Creed Shadows’ story.\nClaws of Awaji’s\nopening mission sets out what’s to follow clearly and creatively. Alongside Junjiro (the Hideout's rambunctious child), Naoe attends a puppet show, where details of the main protagonist’s long-lost Mother have started to emerge. This is when things take a turn, as you play through a 2.5D side-scrolling mission from the perspective of the mysterious Tsuyu, Naoe’s Mother, turned Master Assassin. You go from rooftops to a leap of faith into a darkened courtyard filled with enemies.\nClaws of Awaji\nplaces emphasis on the shadow-based gameplay that I found to be underutilized in the main game, as you extinguish candles and lights to close the distance on foes.\nChronicles of Tsuyu\n(Image credit: Ubisoft)\nThroughout this opening mission, I’m taken back to reflect on one of the most underrated games in the series:\nAssassin’s Creed Chronicles\n. This was a series of three side-scrolling vignettes set in China, India, and Russia, each focusing on a different Assassin and story.\nYou may like\nAssassin's Creed Shadows patch notes confirm the former Claws of Awaji-exclusive Bo weapon will be added to the main game for free\nAssassin's Creed Shadows just got a massive roadmap update, with New Game Plus coming next week\nAssassin's Creed Shadows devs tease the return of some past series lore, including the Assassin vs. Templar conflict, the Isu, and a modern-day storyline – 'You can expect it to be expanded at some point, in some fashion'\nDeveloped by Climax Studios and published by Ubisoft, these unique takes on the Assassin’s Creed franchise tend to go overlooked, with reception having been mixed when the third and final chapter was released back in 2015.\nThe shape of the Assassin’s Creed series has changed dramatically since then, with modern entries focusing on RPG mechanics and tending to leave out the Assassins vs. Templar narratives found in the earlier games. As an OG\nAssassin’s Creed\nfan, I’ve often found myself mourning the loss of what, to me, are integral parts of the series’ identity.\nAC: Chronicles\naren’t the\nbest Assassin’s Creed games\nby a long shot, but they are interesting to go back to and be reminded that, yes, these games used to be about assassins. When placed alongside the context of the current and future AC games,\nAssassin’s Creed Chronicles\nhas only gotten more intriguing and more worth your time as the years have gone by.\nThe ultimate weapon\n(Image credit: Ubisoft)\nClaws of Awaji\nuses the core of\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows\nas a starting point, before leading players through a tighter and decidedly more bespoke journey. Captains patrol the island and are alerted if you get into too much trouble with local guards. These formidable enemies are a challenge to defeat as Naoe, which in turn places a renewed importance on stealth and parkour.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nI spent more time on rooftops, in bushes, and moving through the shadows than I ever did in the base game. This is easy, in part, due to a tighter design in the villages, enemy camps, and forest areas found in\nClaws of Awaji\n. While moving through a camp, I found clear routes laid out in front of me, routes that allowed Naoe to make use of grapple points, ponds, and patches of low grass to move toward targets without being detected. There’s an old-school AC feeling to the gameplay here, and it’s done better than the vast majority of the often-chaotic experiences of\nShadows’\nstealth segments.\nHit-list\n(Image credit: Ubisoft)\nSeveral major targets are given to you from the outset of\nClaws of Awaji\n, and there’s a unique design and theme around each of them. The eagle-eyed, teppo-wielding Nowaki hides out in a haunted forest filled with decoy statues, leading to a boss fight that actually uses stealth in interesting ways.\nThere’s a target that’s pretty much unkillable until you hunt down his captains, and a castle assault that caps off the final boss. You can complete optional quests to change the outcome and difficulty of this final mission, as you poison guards, remove supply lines that rob enemies of ranged weapons, and recruit allies to fight alongside you. It’s reminiscent of some of the missions found in\nAssassin’s Creed Unity\n, with ways to change the battlefield and make new routes to an assassination opportunity.\nYou may like\nAssassin's Creed Shadows patch notes confirm the former Claws of Awaji-exclusive Bo weapon will be added to the main game for free\nAssassin's Creed Shadows just got a massive roadmap update, with New Game Plus coming next week\nAssassin's Creed Shadows devs tease the return of some past series lore, including the Assassin vs. Templar conflict, the Isu, and a modern-day storyline – 'You can expect it to be expanded at some point, in some fashion'\nClaws of Awaji\nhas so many subtle nods to the gameplay of older AC titles. While playing it, I was constantly reminded of why I like this series in the first place, and a little disheartened by how little of that feeling was echoed in my nearly 70 hours spent in the main game. The island of Awaji is much, much smaller than that of the mainland, and really, this highlights the main issue I have with the modern AC games: bloat. Smaller maps lead to more intentional and handcrafted design, something that games like\nAssassin’s Creed Black Flag\n,\nAssassin’s Creed Brotherhood\n, and even\nAssassin’s Creed Mirage\nreally excel at.\nFocus mode\n(Image credit: Ubisoft)\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows\nhas dozens and dozens of hours of content to work through, a humongous map to explore, but at the end of the day, I found\nClaws of Awaji’s\nbite-sized version to be infinitely more compelling. It makes use of stealth to great effect, places an emphasis on exploration by removing the abundance of fast travel points, and all in all, makes proper use of the main game’s central mechanic, the literal ‘Shadows’.\nIt’s frustrating to see the final ending of\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows\noffered in a paid-for DLC, though this is a common theme with the last few major entries. Mostly,\nClaws of Awaji\ndoes everything that the base game does, but just a little bit better, and with at least some of the spirit of what this franchise used to feel like.\nHopefully, Ubisoft can eschew the giant, bloated open worlds and go for something more akin to the smaller, more focused world of\nClaws of Awaji\n.

    "topic": "Microsoft’s Entra ID vulnerabilities could have been catastrophic",
    "source": "dark cloud\nMicrosoft’s Entra ID vulnerabilities could have been catastrophic\nThey could've allowed attacker to gain access to virtually all Azure customer accounts.\nMatt Burgess and Lily Hay Newman, wired.com\n–\nSep 20, 2025 7:15 am\n|\n64\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Getty Images | SOPA Images\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Getty Images | SOPA Images\nText\n        settings\nStory text\nSize\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\n*\nStandard\nWide\nLinks\nStandard\nOrange\n* Subscribers only\nLearn more\nMinimize to nav\nAs businesses around the world have shifted their digital infrastructure over the last decade from self-hosted servers to the\ncloud\n, they’ve benefitted from the standardized, built-in security features of major cloud providers like\nMicrosoft\n. But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially\ndisastrous consequences\nat a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a\npair of vulnerabilities\nin Microsoft Azure’s identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts.\nKnown as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer’s user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to\npresent\nat the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure.\n“I was just staring at my screen. I was like, ‘No, this shouldn’t really happen,’” says Mollema, who runs the Dutch cybersecurity company Outsider Security and specializes in cloud security. “It was quite bad. As bad as it gets, I would say.”\n“From my own tenants—my test tenant or even a trial tenant—you could request these tokens and you could impersonate basically anybody else in anybody else’s tenant,” Mollema adds. “That means you could modify other people's configuration, create new and admin users in that tenant, and do anything you would like.”\nGiven the seriousness of the vulnerability, Mollema disclosed his findings to the Microsoft Security Response Center on July 14, the same day that he discovered the flaws. Microsoft started investigating the findings that day and issued a fix globally on July 17. The company confirmed to Mollema that the issue was fixed by July 23 and implemented extra measures in August. Microsoft\nissued a CVE\nfor the vulnerability on September 4.\n“We mitigated the newly identified issue quickly, and accelerated the remediation work underway to decommission this legacy protocol usage, as part of our Secure Future Initiative,” Tom Gallagher, Microsoft’s Security Response Center vice president of engineering, told WIRED in a statement. “We implemented a code change within the vulnerable validation logic, tested the fix, and applied it across our cloud ecosystem.”\nGallagher says that Microsoft found “no evidence of abuse” of the vulnerability during its investigation.\nBoth vulnerabilities relate to legacy systems still functioning within Entra ID. The first involves a type of Azure authentication token Mollema discovered known as Actor Tokens that are issued by an obscure Azure mechanism called the “Access Control Service.” Actor Tokens have some special system properties that Mollema realized could be useful to an attacker when combined with another vulnerability. The other bug was a major flaw in a historic Azure Active Directory application programming interface known as “Graph” that was used to facilitate access to data stored in Microsoft 365. Microsoft is in the process of retiring Azure Active Directory Graph and transitioning users to its successor, Microsoft Graph, which is designed for Entra ID. The flaw was related to a failure by Azure AD Graph to properly validate which Azure tenant was making an access request, which could be manipulated so the API would accept an Actor Token from a different tenant that should have been rejected.\n“Microsoft built security controls around identity like conditional access and logs, but this internal impression token mechanism bypasses them all,” says Michael Bargury, the CTO at security firm Zenity. “This is the most impactful vulnerability you can find in an identity provider, effectively allowing full compromise of any tenant of any customer.”\nIf the vulnerability had been discovered by, or fallen into the hands of, malicious hackers, the fallout could have been devastating.\n“We don't need to guess what the impact may have been; we saw two years ago what happened when Storm-0558 compromised a signing key that allowed them to log in as any user on any tenant,” Bargury says.\nWhile the specific technical details are different, Microsoft revealed in July 2023 that the Chinese cyber espionage group known as Storm-0558 had stolen a cryptographic key that allowed them to generate authentication tokens and\naccess cloud-based Outlook email systems\n, including those belonging to US government departments.\nConducted over the course of several months, a Microsoft postmortem on the Storm-0558 attack\nrevealed several errors\nthat led to the Chinese group slipping past cloud defenses. The security incident was one of a string of Microsoft issues around that time. These motivated the company to\nlaunch its “Secure Future Initiative\n,” which expanded protections for cloud security systems and set more aggressive goals for responding to vulnerability disclosures and issuing patches.\nMollema says that Microsoft was extremely responsive about his findings and seemed to grasp their urgency. But he emphasizes that his findings could have allowed malicious hackers to go even farther than they did in the 2023 incident.\n“With the vulnerability, you could just add yourself as the highest privileged admin in the tenant, so then you have full access,” Mollema says. Any Microsoft service “that you use EntraID to sign into, whether that be Azure, whether that be SharePoint, whether that be Exchange—that could have been compromised with this.”\nThis story originally appeared on\nwired.com\n.\nWIRED\nWIRED\nWired.com is your essential daily guide to what's next, delivering the most original and complete take you'll find anywhere on innovation's impact on technology, science, business and culture.\n64 Comments",

But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially\ndisastrous consequences\nat a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a\npair of vulnerabilities\nin Microsoft Azure’s identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts.\nKnown as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer’s user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to\npresent\nat the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure.\n“I was just staring at my screen.",

The companies said the first gigawatt of Nvidia systems will come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia's\nVera Rubin\nplatform.\n\"Everything starts with compute,\" said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in the announcement. \"Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.\"\nThe 10-gigawatt project represents an astoundingly ambitious and as-yet-unproven scale for AI infrastructure. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\ntold\nCNBC that the planned 10 gigawatts equals the power consumption of between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units, which matches the company's total GPU shipments for this year and doubles last year's volume. \"This is a giant project,\" Huang said in an interview alongside Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman.\nTo put that power demand in perspective, 10 gigawatts equals the output of\nroughly\n10 nuclear reactors, which typically output about 1 gigawatt per facility. Current data center energy consumption\nranges\nfrom 10 megawatts to 1 gigawatt, with most large facilities consuming between 50 and 100 megawatts. OpenAI's planned infrastructure would dwarf existing installations, requiring as much electricity as multiple major cities.\nThe partnership follows OpenAI's rapid user growth to 700 million weekly active users. Nvidia's stock rose nearly 4 percent on Monday following the announcement, adding roughly $170 billion to its market capitalization. The partnership establishes Nvidia as OpenAI's preferred strategic compute and networking partner, alongside OpenAI's existing relationships with Microsoft, Oracle, SoftBank, and the recently announced\nStargate\nproject partners.\nThe partnership announcement comes a week after Nvidia\ndisclosed\na $5 billion investment in Intel, taking a 4 percent stake in its longtime competitor as the two companies plan to co-develop custom data center and PC products.\nBryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of the investment structure to CNBC. \"Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,\" Talkington told CNBC. \"I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.\"\nRacing for nuclear power\nIn an August earnings call, Huang\ntold\ninvestors that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, with about $35 billion going toward Nvidia chips and systems. At that rate, the 10 gigawatt project could require total investment exceeding $500 billion.\nWhile the companies did not specify power sources in their announcement, the massive energy requirements have driven other tech giants to nuclear partnerships for similar projects. In September 2024, Microsoft\nsigned\na 20-year agreement to restart a Three Mile Island reactor for 835 megawatts, while in May of this year, Amazon Web Services\npurchased\na data center next to Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear plant with plans to use up to 960 megawatts.\nOther massive AI infrastructure projects are emerging across the US. In July, officials in Cheyenne, Wyoming,\nannounced\nplans for an AI data center that would eventually scale to 10 gigawatts—consuming more electricity than all homes in the state combined, even in its earliest 1.8 gigawatt phase. Whether it's connected to OpenAI's plans remains unclear.\nAltman's ambition for mega-sized datacenter deals now\nstretches back\nover a year. In September of last year, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez\ntold\nBloomberg he had heard Altman wanted five to seven data centers of 5 gigawatts each. Alex de Vries of Digiconomist\ntold\nFortune that seven 5-gigawatt units would have \"twice the power consumption of New York State combined.\"\nThe planned infrastructure buildout would significantly increase global energy consumption, which also raises environmental concerns. The International Energy Agency\nestimates\nthat global data centers already consumed roughly 1.5 percent of global electricity in 2024. OpenAI's project also faces practical constraints. Existing power grid connections\nrepresent\nbottlenecks in power-constrained markets, with utilities struggling to keep pace with rapid AI expansion that\ncould push\nglobal data center electricity demand to 945 terawatt hours by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.\nThe companies said they expect to finalize details in the coming weeks. Huang told CNBC the $100 billion investment comes on top of all Nvidia's existing commitments and was not included in the company's recent financial forecasts to investors.\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\nBenj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

    "source": "TechRadar Verdict\nUntil every smartphone comes with native support for audio codecs like LDAC and aptX Adaptive, the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro is a must-have tool for wireless headphone and earbuds users who care about getting the best possible audio quality – and these days, if you're paying for Spotify (or Tidal, or Qobuz, or Apple Music, or several others I could mention) you really ought to care.\nCheck Amazon\nCheck Walmart\nPros\n+\nTiny and featherweight addition to any phone\n+\nSupports all major lossless and hi-res codecs\n+\nWorks with game consoles\nCons\n-\nExpensive\n-\nNo Lightning port support\n-\nCan’t access deeper codec settings\nBest picks for you\nThe best portable DACs 2025\nThe best wireless headphones for 2025\nThe best headphones 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best.\nFind out more about how we test.\nJump to:\nTwo-minute review\nPrice and release date\nSpecs\nFeatures\nDesign\nSound quality\nValue\nShould you buy\nAlso consider\nHow we test\nQuestyle QCC Dongle Pro: Two-minute review\nYou may not realise it, but your phone and your wireless headphones don’t always agree on how good your music should sound. It’s a question of compatibility, and it can be a thorny issue.\nBluetooth audio codecs are the invisible lines of code that translate your music (whether streamed from a subscription service or stored locally on your phone) into something that can be transmitted wirelessly to your headphones, earbuds, or portable speakers.\nAll Bluetooth products support SBC, a codec that provides basic 'vanilla' audio quality, but when it comes to high-quality advanced codecs, like LDAC and\naptX Adaptive\n(which preserve far more of your music’s detail), it’s the wild west out there. Some Android handsets support both. Some just support one. iPhones (in fact, all\nApple\ndevices) support neither. Support on the headphones/earbuds side of the equation can be equally messy – and it doesn't always follow that the more you pay, the more codecs your buds (or cans) will support.\nSo wouldn’t it be nice if there were a tiny, simple (yet powerful) gadget you could plug into any phone, tablet, computer, or game console that would assure you’ve always got support for these codecs? Behold – the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro.\nPlug it in, open the app, and pair your headphones. Done. You’re now listening wirelessly at the highest possible quality (perhaps even losslessly) and you didn’t even have to mess around in Android’s Developer Options.\nAll of this makes the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro a very attractive little accessory for anyone who wants to maximize their listening experience.\nOne of the\nbest portable DACs\naround – and more specifically, one of the\nbest wireless Bluetooth DACs\nwe've tested?

After all, it is\ntiny\n– and this device doesn’t make music or even play music; it just makes the music you already have access to sound better, with no guesswork.\nI’ve also tried the\n$50 FiiO BT11\n, a nearly identical-looking product that, on paper at least, does all the same things. But it’s so maddeningly difficult to use, I’d happily pay the difference for the QCC Dongle Pro.\nStill, there is another option. If you don’t need LDAC (perhaps because your Android phone already supports it), you can get the aptX-family-only QCC Dongle for $69 and save yourself some cash.\nElsewhere (and if you've got hard-to-drive headphones and a little more to spend), we love the\nFiiO BTR17\nfor its amplification powers on top of its codec mastery, and TR's\naudio editor still uses the FiiO BTR7\n– both around $200 / £175 / AU$279.\nQuestyle QCC Dongle Pro review: Specs\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\nQuestyle QCC Dongle Pro: specs\nDimensions\n25mm x 10mm x 15mm\nWeight\n2.5 grams\nSupported codecs\nSBC, aptX, aptX HD, aptX Adaptive (including aptX Lossless), LDAC\nSupported interfaces\nUSB-C, USB-A (UAC 1, UAC 2)\nSystem compatibility\nWinXP/Vista/Win7/Win8/Win10/Win11/Linux/Android/HarmonyOS/macOS/iOS/iPadOS\nBluetooth version\n5.4\nPower draw\n37mA\nQuestyle QCC Dongle Pro review: Features\nExcellent codec support\nEasy, intuitive app\nWorks with almost all USB-equipped devices\nA helpful app lets you control the dongle’s two main functions: getting it paired with your headphones and picking which codec and optional settings you want to use. An LED on the QCC Dongle Pro gives visual feedback on its pairing status as well as which family of codec is currently in use – a reassuring feature.\nBetter yet, as long as your headphones or earbuds support Bluetooth Multipoint, it’s possible to connect them to the dongle and your phone simultaneously. Doing so maintains your ability to adjust the headphones’ settings via their mobile app (if any).\nOh, and one more thing: the dongle also supports USB Audio Class 1 (UAC 1), which is a spec-speak way of saying you can use it as a wireless audio transmitter with gaming consoles like Nintendo Switch and PlayStation families – devices that don’t play nicely with run-of-the-mill USB Bluetooth dongles. Full disclosure: I didn’t test this feature.\nYou can use it as a transmitter for a PC or Mac, too, though with one caveat: there’s no Windows or macOS app, so you’ll need to initially pair your preferred headphones using the mobile app on a phone, then move the dongle over to your PC. It will automatically re-pair with your headphones and then you simply need to choose the Dongle Pro from your computer’s sound output menu.\nWorried about the Dongle Pro sapping your phone’s battery life? Don’t be. With a 37mA draw, Questyle estimates that even if you used it intensively (e.g., with LDAC) for 10 hours straight, you’d only dent an iPhone 16’s full battery capacity by about 10%. Using aptX Adaptive would consume less juice. I didn’t notice any impact on my day-to-day use of my iPhone.\nThe bulk of my testing was done with the Sennheiser IE900 or the Austrian Audio 'The Composer'\n(Image credit: Questyle)\nThe QCC Dongle Pro is so easy and effective that it’s hard to find flaws. But if I were to nitpick, I’d point to the fact that the Questyle app doesn’t give audio nerds as much control over codec behavior as, say, Android’s Developer Options, or the uber-handy\nBluetooth Codec Changer app\n.\nFor instance, purists often want to avoid additional resampling between their source of digital music and the output that gets to their headphones. With the apps/settings I mentioned above, you can set LDAC’s bit-depth and sampling rate to match that of your source. The QCC Dongle Pro doesn’t provide this level of control. The same goes for LDAC’s bitrate; however, you can nonetheless choose to favour sound quality over connection stability, which should accomplish the same thing.\nI might also note that the dongle can’t support simultaneous Bluetooth connections. So if you were hoping to connect a set of wireless earbuds using LDAC and a set of headphones using aptX HD so you can hear the difference, I’m afraid you’ll have to find another way of satisfying your inner scientist.\nFeatures score: 4.5 / 5\nNote the 'wings'\n(Image credit: Future)\nQuestyle QCC Dongle Pro review: Design\nTiny and featherweight\nFits most phone cases\nMight block adjacent ports\nThe QCC Dongle Pro can plug directly into any device that can output audio over USB. At 2.5 grams, it weighs less than half as much as a single AirPods Pro earpiece. On its own, it will snap into USB-C ports, and a small ledge lets it protrude about two millimeters, making it compatible with many 3rd-party protective phone cases. It also comes with an adapter for gadgets that are still rocking USB-A ports. The only devices it can’t support are older iPhones/iPads with Lightning ports.\nIt’s a phone-friendly design, as long as you don’t mind using wireless charging while it’s plugged in. For laptops, especially those like the Apple MacBook Air with just two, closely spaced USB-C ports, the Dongle Pro forces the same choice, but without the fallback of wireless charging: You can have better Bluetooth audio or you can charge your computer, but not both.\nDesign score: 4.5 / 5\nEverything in its right place…\n(Image credit: Future)\nQuestyle QCC Dongle Pro review: Sound quality\nPerfect match for LDAC/aptX devices\nLets you choose which codec to use when more than one will work\nHow does it perform? Brilliantly. Which is to say, when I use it on an iPhone 16 in either LDAC or aptX Lossless mode, with a compatible set of headphones, and then compare it to a phone with these codecs built in (e.g., Motorola ThinkPhone), they sound the same to me. I’m not sure I could ask for anything more.\nSony’s WH-1000XM6\n(LDAC) revealed the subtle details in Dire Straits’\nYou And Your Friend\nthat tend to go missing when listening via AAC. Similarly,\nSennheiser’s aptX Lossless compatible Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds\nwere able to tame the blurry bass notes and crunchy highs that I typically hear when playing Bob Dylan’s\nMan in the Long Black Coat\n.\nGiven how convenient it is to pop the Dongle Pro into the bottom of my iPhone, I can easily see it becoming a permanent fixture in my daily listening life.\nSound quality score: 5 / 5\nThis white light (for aptX Lossless) was oddly hard to come by when using sources able to handle it…\n(Image credit: Future)\nQuestyle QCC Dongle Pro review: Value\nPricey compared to other transmitters\nUnmatched codec support\nPerfect size/shape for mobile use\nThough a pricey little device, you need to look at the QCC Dongle Pro in the context of your other options.\nMost companies that make USB-C Bluetooth transmitters that sell for between $25-$55 on\nAmazon\ncome with one or more compromises. They’re primarily intended for PC use, so they’re often equipped with a USB-A interface. Even the ones with USB-C tend to stick out too far and could easily snap off during portable use. The Dongle Pro’s one direct competitor, the $50 FiiO BT11, is a bargain by comparison – but I found it much harder to use.\nValue score: 4/5\nNote the new 'rails' on the casework to help with cooling\n(Image credit: Future)\nShould you buy the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro?\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\nAttribute\nNotes\nRating\nFeatures\nGives any phone or PC the most popular hi-res Bluetooth audio codecs.\n4 / 5\nSound quality\nWorks as well as any phone with these codecs built in.\n5 / 5\nDesign\nTiny, lightweight, and elegant.

Well, if you’re only interested in using it with an Android phone, it’s definitely worth considering.\nThat’s because, unlike the QCC Dongle Pro, the BT11 isn’t Apple MFi certified. I’m not saying a product has to be MFi certified to work with iPhones, but in this case, it seems to make a big difference.\nWhereas the QCC Dongle Pro just works when you plug it into an iPhone, I found the BT11 suffered from lag and, at times, couldn’t communicate with its companion app at all.\nThis is unfortunate since the BT11 has one skill the QCC Dongle Pro lacks: the ability to connect to two or more audio devices simultaneously.\nIts construction and design aren’t as nice as the Dongle Pro, nor is it as sleek (it sticks out further from the USB-C port). Still, for half the price, maybe that doesn’t matter.\nRead more about\nFiiO BTR11\nand\nFiiO's other DACs\niFi makes strong design choices and you love to see it\n(Image credit: Future)\nHow I tested the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro\nTested for 2 weeks\nUsed it at home and while at the gym\nPredominantly tested using Apple Music on an Apple iPhone 16, but also: Google Pixel 7 Pro, Apple MacBook Air M1\nTesting the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro was primarily a case of comparisons.

I couldn’t detect any.\nFor additional testing, I swapped the dongle over to my MacBook Air and a\nGoogle\nPixel 7 Pro.

The sheer magnitude of the cuts—including a 40 percent slashing of money going to the National Institutes of Health—would do severe harm to biomedical researchers and the industries that serve or rely on them. And, ultimately, that is likely to do harm to all of us.\nIn today's issue of Science, some researchers have attempted to put numbers on those indirect effects that fall within that \"ultimately\" category. They've identified which grants wouldn't have been funded had similar cuts been made earlier in this century and tracked the impact that likely had on drug patents. Their conclusion: Development of roughly half the newly approved drugs relied on work that was funded by a grant that would need to be cut.\nFrom grants to drugs\nIt's uncertain whether the proposed budget cuts will go through. At the moment, Congress is\nlooking to fund most science agencies\nat levels similar to their current budgets. Should cuts eventually happen, then it's also difficult to predict how they'll be spread among the more than 20 institutes that make up the NIH (a number that the administration also wants to see reduced via consolidation). So, the researchers make a big simplifying assumption: Every institute within the NIH will take a 40 percent hit to its budget.\nFrom there, it actually becomes simple to identify the grants that would be dropped as a result of these budget cuts. That's because the NIH operates a system in which each grant submission gets a priority score after evaluation and discussion. Grants are then funded, starting from the top-scoring grant and proceeding down the list, until the budget is exhausted. In this case, one of the researchers had access to every priority score between 1980 and 2007. So, the team simply started with the same list but a 40 percent smaller budget, making it easy to identify the grants that were funded based on the actual budget, but wouldn't have been after a 40 percent cut.\nIt's possible that some of the work funded by these \"at risk\" grants would have been done regardless. But the NIH is the largest supporter of biomedical research on the planet, so there aren't a ton of other options out there.\nIn any case, the researchers decided to look at the impact of the work funded by at-risk grants. Again, there are plenty of ways to judge impact: the patents arising from the work, the number of times papers funded by the grant were cited, and so on. However, the researchers decided to focus on the societal impact using one of the key outcomes of biomedical research: drugs.\nTracing that pathway is also surprisingly easy. The law that governs patenting of federally funded research requires that researchers report any patents arising from research back to the federal government. In addition, patents themselves allow the citation of scientific publications, which can also be traced back to grants.\nSo, the team started with the 557 drugs that have been approved between 2000 and 2023 and looked at the relevant patents, focusing on the ones issued prior to a drug's approval. Those patents were checked for citations of NIH-funded research or direct filings with the government.\nFrom paper to patent\nThe simplest test is how many of them directly acknowledge support from an at-risk grant. That turned out to be 14, or 2.5 percent. While that number seems low, only 7 percent of the drugs in total directly acknowledged NIH support, so the at-risk grants represent a substantial proportion of that.\nBut it's also a somewhat unrealistic measure. Just about anything you do in biology now is based on decades of work done elsewhere, some of which may be absolutely essential to the final piece of research that led to the patent. That sort of intellectual contribution is likely to show up as a citation, rather than a direct acknowledgement. So, the researchers next focused on those citations.\nIt turns out that nearly 60 percent of the patents cite NIH-funded research. And here, the at-risk grants put in a very good showing, with just over half of the patents citing at least one at-risk grant. Note that many grants will have citations from both categories; to get a better sense, the researchers looked for patents where at least a quarter of the papers cited arose from NIH-funded research. For any grant, that number was a bit over 35 percent; for at-risk grants, it was about 12 percent.\nLooking at specific examples, the researchers found that some of the approved drugs that relied on at-risk research were used for cancer treatments and genetic disorders. In other words, treatments that are likely to have a significant impact on public health. There are a couple of reasons to think that this is an underestimation of the impact, as well. To begin with, their source data on funding priorities stops at 2007, leaving a roughly 15-year gap where research funding can't be analyzed, but patents are still being filed.\nIn addition, drugs are just a small part of the potential impact of NIH research. \"We excluded a wide range of important medical advances that may also build on NIH-funded research,\" the researchers acknowledge. \"These include vaccines, gene and cell therapies, and other biologic drugs; diagnostic technologies and medical devices; as well as innovations in medical procedures, patient care practices, and surgical techniques.\" Beyond the obvious implications for public health, these sorts of patents can result in lots of economic activity, including the launching of entirely new businesses.\nBeyond informing current debates about science funding, the research makes a larger point about scientific progress. We tend to focus on the major leaps forward and the high-profile scientists that drive them, as the upcoming Nobel Prizes highlight. But the reality is that most advances, especially in biology, are built on a broad intellectual foundation of lower-profile work that may require years for someone to find a way to apply it to anything patentable. Broad cuts like these may mean that the scientific superstars will still walk away with grants, while leaving a field devastated by having parts of this foundation knocked out from under it.\nScience, 2025.

Protecting APIs now requires in-app defenses that secure the client side.”\nClient-side tampering is common, as attackers can intercept and alter API calls before they reach backend systems.\nEven SSL pinning, designed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, has gaps: nearly 1 in 3 Android finance apps and 1 in 5 iOS travel apps remain vulnerable.\nYou may like\nHackers are cracking mobile browsers to bypass security - here's how they do it and how to stay safe\nAdversarial AI is coming for your applications\nYou wouldn’t skip handwashing – so why skip mobile security hygiene?\nBeyond API exposure, many apps mishandle sensitive data on devices, as Zimperium revealed console logging, external storage, and insecure local storage are common problems.\nFor example, 6% of the top 100 Android apps write personally identifiable information (PII) to console logs, and 4% write it to external storage accessible by other apps.\nEven local storage, although not shared, can become a liability if an attacker gains device access.\nThe analysis also shows nearly a third (31%) of all apps and 37% of the top 100 send PII to remote servers, often without proper encryption.\nCertain apps incorporate SDKs capable of secretly exfiltrating data, recording user interactions, capturing GPS locations, and sending information to external servers.\nThese hidden activities increase enterprise exposure and show that even apps from official stores can carry major security risks.\n“As mobile apps continue to drive business operations and digital experiences, securing APIs from the inside out is critical to preventing fraud, data theft, and service disruption,” added Vishnubhotla.\nHow to stay safe\nInspect apps for improper logging of sensitive information to prevent data leaks.\nVerify that local storage of data is encrypted and not accessible by other apps.\nMonitor network traffic to detect apps sending unencrypted personal information.\nIdentify and remove malicious SDKs or third-party components embedded in apps.\nReview app permissions to ensure they align with intended functionality.\nConduct regular audits of app behavior for potential breach vulnerabilities.\nImplement runtime protections to prevent tampering or reverse engineering of apps.\nUse code obfuscation to shield business logic and API endpoints from attackers.\nValidate that API calls come only from legitimate, untampered applications.\nEstablish incident response procedures in case a mobile app compromise occurs.\nUse mobile security software that protects against malware and\nransomware\nattacks.\nYou might also like\nThese are the\nbest endpoint protection tools\nright now\nTake a look at our pick of the\nbest password managers\nNvidia AI sales to reach almost $400 billion by 2028, research claims - but then things will get a bit tricky for the world's largest company\nTOPICS\nApple\nEfosa Udinmwen\nFreelance Journalist\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

She is also the host of\nHell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home\n, a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.\nMicrosoft is making advances with a new way to cool microchips that it says could lead to more energy-efficient data centers in the future. It’s a method called microfluidics that involves liquid coolant flowing directly into the silicon.\nAfter lab tests, Microsoft found that this strategy can remove heat up to three times better than cold plates currently used in data centers today. The company announced this week that it was able to develop a microfluidic cooling system for a server running core services for a simulated Microsoft Teams meeting.\nIf they can find the same success outside of a lab, microfluidics could cut down the amount of energy needed to cool a data center. It could also lead to more powerful chips that current cooling systems would struggle to keep from overheating. But there are still a lot of factors that could influence how impactful this new technology ultimately is in the real world.\nIt could lead to more powerful chips that current cooling systems would struggle to keep from overheating\nCompared to data centers of yore, the next generation being built to train and run new AI models house more powerful chips. Not only do those GPUs use a lot of energy, they also get very hot. Keeping them cool is a challenge that not only affects performance, but also makes data centers consume more energy.\nTypically, a data center might use fans to pass cool air over a chip. A more advanced technology that Microsoft employs for higher-powered chips involves cold plates made of copper with fluid flowing through them. Put that plate on top of a chip, and it whisks away the heat.\nWith microfluidic cooling, liquid flows through channels etched onto the back of a chip. The trick is making sure the channels, about the width of a human hair, are deep enough to prevent clogging but not so deep that the chip becomes more likely to break. Microsoft says it used AI to figure out where to direct coolant onto a chip to chill it most efficiently. The etched designs are also inspired by nature — mimicking the patterns of veins on leaves, for example — that have already shown how practical they are at distributing water and resources. Using microfluidics, Microsoft documented a 65 percent reduction in the maximum temperature rise of the silicon of a GPU.\nThe advantage with microfluidics is that it brings fluid straight to the chip, eliminating the need for protective layers of materials between the chip and the coolant when cold plates are used. Each layer, like a blanket, holds in some heat, and so the coolant needs to stay colder to work well within cold plates. Cold liquid flows into the plate; hot fluid flows out and needs to be cooled down again. With microfluidics, the coolant doesn’t need to be chilled to as low of a temperature, conserving energy.\nMicrofluidics can also allow a data center to more efficiently handle peaks in demand. Teams calls usually start every hour or half-hour, Microsoft gives as an example. To handle those spikes in demand, they might have to install more servers to have enough capacity on hand even if they won’t be used all the time. The alternative would be to let existing servers work extra hard, called overclocking — but that could lead to overheating and damaging the chip. Microfluidic cooling, because it’s more efficient, can allow for more overclocking without the same risk of a chip melting down.\nIn theory, if servers can work harder than they do now without melting chips down, a data center might not need as many of them. And by minimizing the risk of overheating, microfluidics could also allow for more tightly packed servers within a single data center. It could cut the costs, literal and environmental, of needing to build additional facilities.\nAll these benefits could be key for next-generation microchips, which are expected to become so powerful that cold plates may fall short. Microsoft says that microfluidics could also enable 3D chip architecture. 3D chips would be even more powerful than today’s semi-flat designs, but heat has been a stumbling block for making this happen. With microfluidics, however, there’s the possibility of flowing coolant through the chip.\nEfficiency can also be a double-edged sword\nMicrosoft doesn’t have a timeline for when this all might happen. After more lab testing comes the challenge of figuring out how to make the hardware and supply chain changes needed to allow for microfluidics — for example, at what point in the manufacturing process will grooves be etched into the chips? Fortunately, they can use the same kind of coolant, a mix of water and propylene glycol, used today in cold plates.\nOther researchers have been studying microfluidics for years also. HP, for example, was awarded $3.25 million in\nfunding\nfrom the Department of Energy last year to develop its own microfluidic cooling technology. “All these things are good to see, we’re happy to see them, and where we can participate to move things faster we’re happy to,” says Husam Alissa, director of systems technology in Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft.\nMicrosoft says it “hopes to help pave the way for more efficient and sustainable next-generation chips across the industry” in its recent\nblog post\ntouting its progress on microfluidics. Energy efficiency is crucial if the company wants to operate more sustainably. Like other\ntech companies\n, Microsoft’s planet-heating\ncarbon emissions have grown\nas it leaned into generative AI. But efficiency can also be a double-edged sword. As something becomes more efficient and affordable to use, people tend to use much more of it and that could ultimately lead to an even bigger environmental footprint. It’s a phenomenon called the Jevons paradox, which even Microsoft CEO\nSatya Nadella has commented on\nas a force driving greater adoption of AI.\n0\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nJustine Calma\nClose\nJustine Calma\nSenior Science Reporter\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nJustine Calma\nAI\nClose\nAI\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAI\nAnalysis\nClose\nAnalysis\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAnalysis\nClimate\nClose\nClimate\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nClimate\nEnergy\nClose\nEnergy\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nEnergy\nMicrosoft\nClose\nMicrosoft\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nMicrosoft\nReport\nClose\nReport\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nReport\nScience\nClose\nScience\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nScience\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’\nLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sun\nPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailers\nGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next year\nForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

That includes letting users search through personal data stored on their phone, like their emails and messages, or taking action in apps, like editing photos. The new app is apparently also a way for Apple to \"gather feedback on whether the chatbot format has value,\"\nBloomberg\nwrites.\nWhile an internal app doesn't make it any clearer how useful Apple's updated Siri will be, it does suggest the project is in a more advanced stage than before.

People are eagerly lapping up the misinformation spewed and disseminated by AI chatbots, which are only just getting started.\nIt is against this backdrop that a climate scientist and a vaccine developer teamed up to write\nScience Under Siege\n. It is about as grim as you’d expect.\nScience Under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces That Threaten Our World\nBy Michael E. Mann and Peter J. Hotez\nMichael Mann is a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who, in 1998, developed the notorious hockey stick graph, which demonstrated that global surface temperatures were roughly flat until around the year 1900, when they started rising precipitously (and have not stopped). Peter Hotez is a microbiologist and pediatrician at Baylor College of Medicine whose group developed a low-cost, patent-free COVID-19 vaccine using public funds (i.e., not from a pharmaceutical company) and distributed it to almost a hundred million people in India and Indonesia.\nUnlikely crusaders\nNeither of them anticipated becoming crusaders for their respective fields—and neither probably anticipated that their respective fields would ever actually need crusaders. But they each have taken on the challenge, and they’ve been rewarded for their trouble with condemnation and harassment from Congress and death threats from the public they are trying to serve. In this book, they hope to take what they’ve learned as scientists and science communicators in our current world and parlay that into a call to arms.\nMann and Hotez have more in common than being pilloried all over the internet. Although they trained in disparate disciplines, their fields are now converging (as if they weren’t each threatening enough on their own). Climate change is altering the habitats, migrations, and reproductive patterns of pathogen-bearing wildlife like bats, mosquitoes, and other insects. It is causing the migration of humans as well. Our increasing proximity to these species in both space and time can increase the opportunities for us to catch diseases from them.\nYet Mann and Hotez insist that a third scourge is even more dangerous than these two combined. In their words:\nIt is currently impossible for global leaders to take the urgent actions necessary to respond to the climate crisis and pandemic threats because they are thwarted by a common enemy—\nantiscience\n—that is politically and ideologically motivated opposition to any science that threatens powerful special interests and their political agendas. Unless we find a way to overcome antiscience, humankind will face its gravest threat yet—the collapse of civilization as we know it.\nAnd they point to an obvious culprit: “There is, unquestionably, a coordinated, concerted attack on science by today’s Republican Party.”\nThey’ve helpfully characterized “the five principal forces of antiscience “ into alliterative groups: (1) plutocrats and their political action committees, (2) petrostates and their politicians and polluters, (3) fake and venal professionals—physicians and professors, (4) propagandists, especially those with podcasts, and (5) the press. The general tactic is that (1) and (2) hire (3) to generate deceitful and inflammatory talking points, which are then disseminated by all-too-willing members of (4) and (5).\nThere is obviously a lot of overlap among these categories; Elon Musk, Vladimir Putin, Rupert Murdoch, and Donald Trump can all jump between a number of these bins. As such, the ideas and arguments presented in the book are somewhat redundant, as are the words used. Far too many things are deemed “ironic” (i.e., the same people who deny and dismiss the notion of human-caused climate change claimed that Democrats generated hurricanes Helene and Milton to target red states in October 2024) or “risible” (see Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s claim that Dr. Peter Hotez sought to make it a felony to criticize Anthony Fauci).\nA long history\nAntiscience propaganda has been used by authoritarians for over a century. Stalin imprisoned physicists and attacked geneticists while famously enacting the nonsensical agricultural ideas of Trofim Lysenko, who thought genes were a “bourgeois invention.” This led to the starvation of millions of people in the Soviet Union and China.\nWhy go after science? The scientific method is the best means we have of discovering how our Universe works, and it has been used to reveal otherwise unimaginable facets of reality. Scientists are generally thought of as authorities possessing high levels of knowledge, integrity, and impartiality. Discrediting science and scientists is thus an essential first step for authoritarian regimes to then discredit any other types of learning and truth and destabilize their societies.\nThe authors trace the antiscience messaging on COVID, which followed precisely the same arc as that on climate change except condensed into a matter of months instead of decades. The trajectory started by maintaining that the threat was not real. When that was no longer tenable, it quickly morphed into \"OK, this is happening, and it may actually get pretty bad for some subset of people, but we should definitely not take collective action to address it because that would be bad for the economy.\"\nIt finally culminated in preying upon people’s understandable fears in these very scary times by claiming that this is all the fault of scientists who are trying to take away your freedom, be that bodily autonomy and the ability to hang out with your loved ones (COVID) or your plastic straws, hamburgers, and SUVs (climate change).\nThis mis- and disinformation has prevented us from dealing with either catastrophe by misleading people about the seriousness, or even existence, of the threats and/or harping on their hopeless nature, sapping us of the will to do anything to counter them. These tactics also sow division among people, practically ensuring that we won’t band together to take the kind of collective action essential to addressing enormous, complex problems. It is all quite effective. Mann and Hotez conclude that “the future of humankind and the health of our planet now depend on surmounting the dark forces of antiscience.”\nWhy, you might wonder, would the plutocrats, polluters, and politicians of the Republican Party be so intent on undermining science and scientists, lying to the public, fearmongering, and stoking hatred among their constituents? The same reason as always: to hold onto their money and power. The means to that end is thwarting regulations. Yes, it's nefarious, but also so disappointingly… banal.\nThe authors are definitely preaching exclusively to the converted. They are understandably angry at what has been done to them and somewhat mocking of those who don’t see things their way. They end by trying to galvanize their followers into taking action to reverse the current course.\nThey advise that the best—really, the only—thing we can do now to effect change is to vote and hope for favorable legislation. “Only political change, including massive turnout to support politicians who favor people over plutocrats, can ultimately solve this larger systemic problem,” they write. But since our president and vice president don’t even believe in or acknowledge “systemic problems,” the future is not looking too bright.\nDiana Gitig\nAssociate Writer\nDiana Gitig\nAssociate Writer\n109 Comments",

But at $89.99, let’s be real, it’s way too expensive for most people. Thankfully, a controller I’ve been testing recently, which is nearly as good despite lacking a 3.5mm audio jack, is currently on sale for $40 less. The\nEasySMX S10\n, as it’s called, is available for $50.39 from\nEasySMX\nwith code\nGETS10\n.\nRelated\nHere are 50 great deals you can snag ahead of Amazon’s fall Prime Day\nAmazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max is $20 off right now\nThe S10 is comfortable to use for long gaming sessions, and it has features that aren’t commonly built into third-party gamepads, including amiibo support and rumble that feels like it’s in the same ballpark as Nintendo’s HD rumble. It can also remotely wake the Nintendo Switch 2, not just the original Switch, from standby.\nThe S10 would be easier to recommend than Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller even if they were the same price, since EasySMX’s model features accurate, power-efficient TMR joysticks, plus some satisfyingly clicky buttons and triggers (note: these are divisive, you might not like them as much as I do). But at $40 less, you don’t need to feel bad about getting this instead of Nintendo’s official gamepad. Take that leftover money and treat yourself to something nice instead.\nEasySMX S10 Gaming Controller for Switch 2\n$\n50\n$\n60\n17\n% off\n$\n50\n$60 at Amazon\n$50 at EasySMX (with code GETS10)\nIf you’re an Android user looking for an unobtrusive Bluetooth tracker for your wallet, Ugreen just launched the\nFineTrack Slim Smart G\n. It’s just 1.7mm thick (approximately the thickness of two credit cards), letting it to sit next to your other cards without sticking out, and its built-in battery can last for up to five years. For its launch, Ugreen has knocked $2 off the $25.99 tracker, dropping it to $23.99 at\nAmazon\n.\nThe downside is that it can’t be charged, so you’ll need to dispose of it and buy a new tracker once those five years are up. That stinks, but its specs mean it should provide a pretty good five years of service. It features a built-in 80db alarm to help you find it via Google’s Find Hub network, after all, along with IP68 protection against dust and water. Just keep in mind that, if it’s submerged, you won’t be able to track it.\nUgreen FineTrack Slim Smart G Bluetooth tracker\n$\n24\n$\n26\n8\n% off\n$\n24\n$24 at Amazon\nNow through October 5th, OnePlus has a few back-to-college deals up its sleeve that everyone can enjoy, whether you’re a student or not. The one that caught my eye is the 43mm\nOnePlus Watch 3\n, which is available for $269.99 ($30 off) from\nAmazon\nand\nOnePlus\n(with coupon code\nHARVEST\n). The Wear OS 5-equipped smartwatch has gone on sale before, but after a nearly month-long period when it wasn’t discounted, it’s returned to its second-best price to date.\nIf you’re shopping for an Android watch, we recommend including OnePlus’ latest wearable on your shortlist. Outside of Samsung’s\nrecent Galaxy Watch 8 series\n, the OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the newest models available. It offers a better value than its predecessor, the\nOnePlus Watch 2\n, with updated software, a rotating crown, an enhanced GPS antenna, and a suite of new health features.\nRead our hands-on impressions\n.\nOnePlus Watch 3 (43mm)\n$\n270\n$\n300\n10\n% off\n$\n270\n$270 at Amazon\n$270 at OnePlus (with code HARVEST)\nOther deals we loved from this week\nNintendo’s tappable\namiibos\nare an expensive hobby, as most figures for the Switch and Switch 2 usually cost between $15 and $40 each. However,\nGameStop\nrecently did collectors and trinket enjoyers a favor by slashing prices on a handful of models, which start at just $5.99 a pop. Not just that, some of the newer ones that debuted alongside the Switch 2 (including ones from\nThe Legend of Zelda\nseries and\nStreet Fighter 6\n) are down to $15.99 at\nGameStop\nand\nAmazon\n— over half off their original price.\nWe highlighted the Prime-exclusive deal on\nKindle Unlimited\nlast weekend, but it’s worth sharing again in case you missed it. If you sign into your Prime account ahead of Amazon’s\nOctober Prime Day event\n, which starts on October 7th, you’ll be able to sign up for\na free three-month trial\nof Kindle Unlimited. After your free trial period ends, you’ll be charged $11.99 a month unless you cancel the service. Kindle Unlimited is filled with many, many titles you can read for no extra charge, so if you’re a voracious reader, this is a fabulous deal that costs nothing to redeem.\nIf you’re a PC gamer with a taste for spooky games, you might have already dipped into several titles from Remedy Entertainment’s catalog, including\nAlan Wake 2\n,\nControl\n, and others. But if you haven’t yet tried them, there’s an affordable way to go all-in, as\nHumble is offering a nine-game bundle\nfor just $27. Getting\nAlan Wake 2\n(redeemable via the Epic Games Store) at that price would be a steal on its own, but you also get\nControl Ultimate Edition\n,\nQuantum Break\n,\nAlan Wake Remastered\n,\nMax Payne\n,\nMax Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne\n, and more. The step-up tier of the bundle also includes a 25 percent off coupon for\nFBC: Firebreak\n, Remedy’s cooperative first-person shooter set in the\nControl\nuniverse.\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nCameron Faulkner\nClose\nCameron Faulkner\nEditor, Commerce\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nCameron Faulkner\nDeals\nClose\nDeals\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nDeals\nGaming\nClose\nGaming\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGaming\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nCostco is already selling piles of Lego Game Boys cheaper than the Lego company\nRaleigh One e-bike review: redemption tour\nX-ray scans reveal the hidden risks of cheap batteries\nSamsung now owns Denon, Bowers & Wilkins, Marantz, Polk, and more audio brands\nPentagon can call DJI a Chinese Military Company, court rules\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

    "topic": "The billion-dollar infrastructure deals powering the AI boom",
    "source": "It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.\nBelow, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.\nMicrosoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI\nThis is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom:\nIn 2019\n, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come\nin the form of Azure cloud credit\nrather than cash.\nIt was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.\nThe partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would\nno longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively\n, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.\nOpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while\nmaking kernel-level modifications\non the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on\nsmaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf\nas “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia\nin September\n, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.\nThe rise of Oracle\nOn June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year.

Oracle’s stock\nclimbed even higher\n, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith.\nBut before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.\nBuilding tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers\nFor companies like Meta that already have\nsignificant legacy infrastructure\n, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure\nthrough the end of 2028\n.\nIn just the first half of 2025, the company spent\n$30 billion more\nthan the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent\n$10 billion deal with Google Cloud\n, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers.\nA new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana,\ndubbed Hyperion\n, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and\nprovide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power\n. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas.\nThat kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that\nexperts say violate the Clean Air Act\n.\nThe Stargate moonshot\nJust two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history. Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.”\nIn broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.\nAs the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum.\nIn August\n, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of\neight data centers in Abilene, Texas\n, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.\nThis article was first published on September 22.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nevergreens\n,\nMeta\n,\nMicrosoft\n,\nnvidia\n,\noracle\n,\nSoftbank\n,\nstargate\nRussell Brandom\nAI Editor\nRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "summary": "It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.\nBelow, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.\nMicrosoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI\nThis is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom:\nIn 2019\n, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come\nin the form of Azure cloud credit\nrather than cash.\nIt was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.\nThe partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would\nno longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively\n, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more in...",

Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out\nthe earlier pieces in the series\n!\nI love 4X games. I've tried other strategy game genres, but frankly, they don't stick if they're not first and foremost 4X games—at the heart of it, it must be about exploring, expanding, exploiting, and yes, exterminating.\nI suspect that the first 4X game most people played was some entry in the Civilization franchise—though certainly, a select few played precursors dating back to text-based games in the 1970s.\nBut for me, the title that kicked off my obsession was\nMaster of Orion II\n(\nMOO2\n)—a game that has you develop and build up planets across a simple galaxy map, researching speculative future technologies, and ultimately wiping out your opponents and claiming dominion over the known universe. (There are other victory conditions too, but that one is the most fun.)\nThere is something satisfying about making a couple thousand small choices that all add up to that galaxy map gradually changing color in your favor until the final cut scene plays, declaring you the true Master of Orion.\nThe games I love the most are the ones where you make decisions that compound over many, many hours to a long-term payoff. I'll take that over games with bite-sized, contained challenges and short play times any day. The deeper and longer the experience, the better the payoff can be. To me, that's ultimately what makes 4X games great.\nMOO2\nis no exception.\nI needed this validation.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Samuel Axon\nNostalgic but flawed\nThat said, it's not a perfect game. It benefited from the lessons it could learn from more than a decade of 4X games before it, and its designers were clearly thinking about how to make it balanced and fun.\nThey just missed the mark sometimes. For example, a big part of the game is choosing perks that customize your empire from before the first turn. One of those perks is called \"Creative,\" which allows you to learn multiple technologies at once rather than one at a time. It's pretty hard to imagine anyone consciously declining to choose that perk unless they're looking to make things a lot harder for themselves.\nThat's fine in single-player, as it basically makes perks like this just gameplay variants or mutators to make replaying and seeking new challenges fun. But in multiplayer, well... I'm not involved in the competitive\nMOO2\nscene, so I suppose I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure you're going to spend those six points on Creative, and that's that.\nMaster of Orion II\nalso arrived at a time when the complexity in the genre had reached deeper levels than ever before—but it also came out before some pretty important innovations in battling the busywork that comes from maintaining that level of complexity well into a late game when you have several dozen colonies. That awkward position means that it's way too easy to get bogged down in too many details in the late game.\nI think the visuals hold up pretty well.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Samuel Axon\nStill, I was surprised how well this game held up after 30 years. Sometimes—like in the case of\nThe Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall\n, t\nhe previous game I wrote about\nin this C:\\ArsGames series—I visit a game from that era and go, \"Yeah, I can definitely see that most modern players wouldn't dig this.\" Aside from that busywork criticism, I feel like there would be very little to stop someone who's never played\nMOO2\nor its contemporaries before from enjoying it if they tried it now.\nIts design largely holds up, it has great music and atmosphere, and I feel that despite its many, many spiritual successors over the years, none have really managed to capture the purity of this \"total interstellar dominance\" fantasy quite as well as\nMOO2\ndid.\nGuilt-free conquest\nIn the last entry in this series, my esteemed colleague Kyle Orland wrote that\nSimCity 2000\nhits differently for him\nnow because he cares a little bit too much about the consequences for his fictional citizens—his moral compass kicks in to a degree it didn't used to.\nI respect that. But...\nI will confess that when I returned to\nMOO2\nthis week, I had no such compunction. Frankly, I could hardly contain my glee as my Stellar Converter (basically a legally distinct Death Star) shattered entire planets, wiping out populations in the billions. That's one of the things I remember most about\nMOO2\nfrom back in the day, and for me, it's one of the things that holds up the best!\nYou can skip the brief CGI cinematic showing the planet breaking apart before your immense technological power, but why would you? My playthrough ended—as\nMOO2\ngames so often do—with my fleet of Stellar Converters obliterating about 20-some planets owned by an opposing faction. I watched the entire animation every single time—after all, that's the aforementioned payoff I was building toward.\nI will never not watch these planets get blown up. It is almost the entire point.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Samuel Axon\nI think that, fundamentally, the fantasy of ruthless dominance is the main appeal of the game. It's probably not a game for you if that doesn't resonate with some part of your brain. That's not what resonates with me in real life, but this is a video game, in this video game, I call the planet-destroying shots, and I like it.\nPlaying\nMOO2\nin 2025\nUnlike some other 90s classics like\nDaggerfall\nor\nDescent\n, there hasn't been a big community effort to effectively remaster\nMOO2\nfor modern systems. I think that's fine in this case—it runs well in DOSBox on any machine, and the stylistic choices its original developers made mean it has aged well.\nThere have been some patches over the years (both official and unofficial), and they're included\nin the GOG release\n. As with other beloved classics, you should be able to find people to play multiplayer with on Reddit or Discord.\nYou could argue that there's no point in revisiting\nMOO2\nwhen something much more sprawling and interesting like\nStellaris\nexists today, but like I said, the execution on that galactic domination fantasy has a particularly pure expression here. It's worth it if that's your jam.\nSamuel Axon\nSenior Editor\nSamuel Axon\nSenior Editor\nSamuel Axon is the editorial lead for tech and gaming coverage at Ars Technica.

He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.\nFor most of his career Larry Ellison has been content to quietly let Oracle be the company, behind the company, behind the technology that makes headlines. Its biggest products being cloud computing and database products that it sells to enterprise customers like DHL, Northwell Health, and Fanatics. But, now in his 80s, Ellison has begun a second act shifting from Silicon Valley pioneer, to media mogul.\nCompared to many of the other people at the top of the\nForbes Billionaires\nlist, Larry Ellison tends to keep a low profile. That’s not to say he hasn’t seen his fair share of headlines, especially in recent years. But he, and his company Oracle, aren’t being routinely dragged\nin front of congress\nfor\nhigh profile\nshouting matches, or being accused of ruining an entire\ngeneration of children\nin op-ed pages.\nBut over the course of his career, Ellison has developed a reputation for ruthless and sometimes ethically dubious behavior as head of Oracle. Biographer Karen Southwick even called him a “\nmodern-day Genghis Khan\n.” Her book\nEveryone Else Must Fail: The Unvarnished Truth About Oracle and Larry Ellison\n, released in 2003, already identified Ellison as a man who would stop at nothing to have absolute power over his company, or his industry, purging executives “who dare to stand up to him” and engaging in hostile takeovers of competitors. He even bought most of a\nHawaiian island\n, where the population is suspiciously exuberant in their praise of him.\nHis ventures into the media space began modestly enough by backing Annapurna Pictures and Skydance Productions, companies founded by his children Megan and David Ellison, respectively. Eventually both of those companies expanded to become major players in the television and video game spaces. But things have accelerated dramatically since then.\nHe briefly\nexpanded his power\nat Annapurna in 2018 as his daughter’s studio found itself buried in debt. His role in day-to-day operations isn’t clear, but he spearheaded a reorganization of the company, brokered a deal to pay off the\n$200 million in debt\n, and changed how Annapurna would finance films going forward. Rather than rely on bank loans, the studio would seek investors for projects on a case-by-case basis or simply be financed by Megan Ellison entirely.\nIn 2022 Larry Ellison\ngave Elon Musk $1 billion\nto help fund his purchase of Twitter (now X). And last year Skydance Media merged with Paramount creating a conglomerate with almost unmatched reach. While Larry’s son David runs Paramount on paper, it’s the father who\nactually owns the company\n. This means that Larry Ellison owns a controlling stake in a broadcast network (CBS), a major streaming platform (Paramount+), multiple movie studios, CBS News, and pay-TV channels like Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and Showtime.\nAnd now Oracle is likely going to own a major portion of TikTok in the US.\nMany\ndetails\nof the deal are\nstill\nmurky\n, and there’s been some\ncontradictory\nreporting about what will and won’t remain in ByteDance’s control. But as Clare Malone says in a recent\nNew Yorker\narticle, it’s unlikely the deal will do much to address any of the supposed national security concerns around TikTok and, “instead, the deal’s more immediate impact would be to bolster an emerging media conglomerate, under the auspices of the Ellison family, who are assiduously friendly to Trump.”\nRelated\nWhat is the correct amount of pro-Palestine content?\nI think Malone is underselling things quite a bit in describing the family’s empire as “emerging” however. Paramount Skydance is already one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. And one that has shown a willingness to make decisions destined to please the president, like pushing a prominent critic of the administration in Stephen Colbert, off the air. David Ellison is also rumored to be in talks to acquire Bari Weiss’\nThe Free Press\n, and “the new owner of CBS News is weighing giving Ms. Weiss the job of editor in chief or co-president of the network,” according to the\nNew York Times\n. Weiss portrays herself as a sort of centrist provocateur, though the most frequent target of her antagonism is the “mainstream media,” a foil that lines up nicely with the White House’s interests.\nSome of this embracing of right wing interests and offering tokens of appeasement might seem par for the course to keep the White House off your back as a media company in 2025. But Larry Ellison’s behavior over the last 40-plus years has shown he won’t let things like rules, or even good sportsmanship, stand in the way of him getting what he wants. Oracle’s yachting team was caught\ncheating at the 2013 America’s Cup\nand Ellison famously\nhired private detectives\nto dig up dirt on Microsoft and Bill Gates during the company’s monopoly woes in 1999.\nNow Paramount is reportedly looking to\nacquire Warner Bros. Discovery\n, which would give the family ownership of another major movie studio, another major streaming service (HBO Max), CNN, and more. To call the scope such a merger unprecedented would be dramatically underselling things.\nWhat makes this family empire so unique is, as the\nNew York Times\npoints out, if he wants to continue to build out his budding media monolith, money isn’t a constraint. Larry Ellison’s wealth fluctuates by as much as\n$100 billion a day\n— more than the GDP of roughly two-thirds of the world’s countries according to the\nInternational Monetary Fund\n. While Ellison hasn’t shown much of a penchant for running a media company so far, his staggering wealth gives him plenty of leeway for making mistakes and learning on the job.\nRelated\nOpenAI reportedly signs $300 billion Project Stargate cloud deal with Oracle\nLarry Ellison already had his hands on a significant amount of American medical and financial data through Oracle. He’s helped build some of the world’s largest\nAI datacenters\n. Last year he added a major news outlet and traditional media conglomerate to his portfolio and, unless something unexpected happens, he’ll wield significant influence over one of the world’s biggest social media networks. In what feels like record time Larry Ellison has gone from a relatively lowkey, if excessively wealthy and flamboyant, tech CEO to one of the most powerful people in the world. And all the while his politics seem to be taking a\nmore conspiratorial bent\n.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nTerrence O'Brien\nClose\nTerrence O'Brien\nWeekend Editor\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nTerrence O'Brien\nCreators\nClose\nCreators\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nCreators\nEntertainment\nClose\nEntertainment\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nEntertainment\nPolicy\nClose\nPolicy\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPolicy\nReport\nClose\nReport\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nReport\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nTikTok\nClose\nTikTok\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTikTok\nMore in this stream\nSee all\nThe TikTok deal raises more questions than answers\nEmma Roth\nand\nLauren Feiner\nSep 26\nTrump signs ‘Saving TikTok’ order to start resolving its big ban problem\nEmma Roth\nand\nTina Nguyen\nSep 25\nSome details of the TikTok deal have been worked out.\nTerrence O'Brien\nSep 20\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nWhat to expect from Amazon’s big fall hardware event on Tuesday\nI spent three months with Telly, the free TV that’s always showing ads\nWhen this EV maker collapsed, its customers became the car company\nRaleigh One e-bike review: redemption tour\nXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteries\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

F-Droid, the free and open source app repository, isn't waiting for the full rollout to take a position. In a blog post, F-Droid staff say that Google's plan to force devs outside Google Play to register with the company threatens to kill alternative app stores like F-Droid.\nF-Droid has been around for about 15 years and is the largest source of free and open source software (FOSS) for Android. Because the apps in F-Droid are not installed via the Play Store, you have to sideload each APK manually, and Google is targeting that process in the name of security.\nSeveral weeks ago, Google announced plans to force all Android app developers to register their apps and identity with Google. Apps that have not been validated by the Big G will not be installable on any certified Android devices in the future. Since virtually every Android device outside of China runs Google services, that means Google is in control of the software we get to install on Android.\nAccording to F-Droid\n, Google's verification program threatens to break free app distribution. Google claims that attaching real identities to apps reduces the incidence of malware, which it has seen in action in Google Play. Still, the Play Store is\nnot free of bad apps\n, which F-Droid points to as evidence that Google's moves won't actually eliminate the risks of sideloading.\nGoogle's approach to verification would be a real problem for F-Droid's operation. F-Droid doesn't allow tracking or invasive advertising in the apps it distributes. Each app is provided to the platform in the form of source code, which is verified and then compiled by F-Droid. The site operators say they cannot require devs to register with Google, nor can they \"take over\" the app identifiers to register for them. Doing so would effectively take over distribution rights from the authors.\nF-Droid warns that the project will end if Google is allowed to seize control of the entire Android software ecosystem by way of its developer verification program. In addition to gathering personal information from devs, F-Droid says Google will be demanding registration fees from independent developers, many of whom give their apps away for free and would be uninterested in paying Google for the privilege.\nGoogle's application to test verification does ask if you can pay in USD, suggesting it will charge devs for the privilege of creating Android apps.\nCredit:\n                                      Ryan Whitwam\nGoogle's application to test verification does ask if you can pay in USD, suggesting it will charge devs for the privilege of creating Android apps.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Ryan Whitwam\nGoogle has been slow to provide details of the verification system. However, you can sign up for the early access program. During that process, Google\ndoes\nask if you are able to pay registration fees in US dollars, which suggests there will be a cost for developers in the program. We've reached out to Google for more information.\nA plea for regulation\nF-Droid's position is clear: If you own a device, you should be allowed to decide what software to run on it. To force everyone to register with a central authority is an affront to the ideas of free speech and thought, says F-Droid.\nSo what's the solution? In the blog post, Google is accused of using security as a mask for what is really an attempt to consolidate monopoly power over app distribution at a time when its power is being suppressed by antitrust actions. F-Droid is calling on regulators from the US and EU to take a close look at Google's plans before it's too late.\nGoogle is currently on the verge of massive court-mandated changes to the Play Store. After losing the antitrust case brought by Epic Games, Google also\nlost the appeal\n. As it explores further legal maneuvering, the firm may have to begin\nopening up its app distribution system\nby promoting third-party stores on Google Play and mirroring Google Play content in other storefronts. This will reduce Google's monopoly power in Android apps, which is the court's intention. However, the company's new goal of locking down sideloading could maintain its central role in Android software.\nF-Droid calls on concerned developers and users to contact their government representatives to demand action. Specifically, the site suggests invoking the European Commission’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) to keep FOSS apps free from Google's gatekeeping.\nWhile the pilot verification program is set to launch next month, it will be almost a year before unverified apps will be blocked. That will start with a handful of markets, including Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. The restrictions are expected to expand globally in 2027.\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

Still, the Play Store is\nnot free of bad apps\n, which F-Droid points to as evidence that Google's moves won't actually eliminate the risks of sideloading.\nGoogle's approach to verificatio...",

Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimes\nonly\nwork at all — with the company’s own devices. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, live translation, Apple TV integration, and more.\nRelated\nThe best wireless earbuds to buy right now\nHere are the best AirPods deals you can get right now\nApple’s AirPods update adds camera controls and more\nThere are currently four AirPods models to choose from, each with its own distinct appeal and upside. You likely already know whether you’re more interested in earbuds or over-ear headphones, so that’s the first divide. In the case of over-ear headphones, your only choice is the AirPods Max. But in the earbuds category, Apple offers three options: the AirPods Pro 3, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and the plain old AirPods 4.\nIn this article\nThe best AirPods overall\nThe best AirPods for those who find ear tips uncomfortable\nThe best for those who prefer headphones\nWhat’s coming next\nThe best AirPods overall\n9\nVerge Score\nAirPods Pro 3\n$\n249\n$\n249\nThe Good\nImproved ANC and sound\nLonger battery\nStandalone workout tracking\nLive translation\nSame price\nIP57\nBetter fit\nCamera remote control is handy!\nThe Bad\nIf you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that\n$249 at Amazon\n$249 at Apple\n$250 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nNoise cancellation:\nYes /\nBattery life:\n8 hours (ANC on) /\nWater resistance:\nIP57 /\nBluetooth codecs:\nAAC, SBC /\nMultipoint:\nNo\n/\nWorks best with:\niOS, Windows, macOS /\nEar tips:\nFoam and silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)\nThe third-generation AirPods Pro are better than its predecessor in numerous ways, starting with the fit. Apple’s latest flagship earbuds feature a more angular design and a wider range of ear tip sizes — including an XXS option. These “foam-infused” tips combine foam and silicone, so they expand slightly for better comfort and a tighter seal. If you’ve ever cursed at AirPods for falling out of your ears, the Pro 3’s improved fit alone might sell you.\nThey also deliver upgrades to noise cancellation — even rivaling the over-ear AirPods Max. They’re noticeably better at dampening high-frequency sounds, like voices, than prior generations of AirPods Pro, and they can eliminate the low hum of an airplane engine. Sound quality has also been improved in ways that were surprisingly easy to pick out: bass is punchier, vocals are clearer, and you’ll notice new layers in your favorite tracks. Meanwhile, battery life will last you a full work day with ANC enabled before the buds need to go back into the charging case for a refill.\nRelated\nApple isn’t packing a charging cable in with the AirPods Pro 3\nApple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound\nHow the new AirPods Pro compare to the rest of Apple’s AirPods lineup\nIn addition to giving users the flexibility to use these earbuds as a\nclinical-grade hearing aid\n— a feature introduced last year — Apple has added a heart rate sensor to this model, allowing you to track workouts right from your ears. Add in IP57 water and dust resistance, stronger Find My capabilities, and a live translation feature, and it’s clear the AirPods Pro are Apple’s best wireless earbuds by a wide margin.\nRead our full AirPods Pro 3 review\n.\nThe best AirPods for those who find ear tips uncomfortable\n7\nVerge Score\nApple AirPods 4\n$\n119\n$\n130\n8\n% off\n$\n119\nThe Good\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\nThe Bad\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n$119 at Amazon\n$119 at Walmart\n$121 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nNoise cancellation:\nNo /\nBattery life:\n5 hours /\nWater resistance:\nIP54 /\nBluetooth codecs:\nAAC, SBC /\nMultipoint:\nNo /\nWorks best with:\niOS, Windows, macOS\nNot everyone likes the way ear tips feel. Even with venting and the other measures Apple has taken to improve comfort and reduce that clogged-up sensation in the AirPods Pro 3, some people just prefer the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods. Their open design means you’re never totally cut off from the outside world. The AirPods Pro have an impressive transparency mode, but the AirPods 4 don’t need it.\nApple sells two versions of the AirPods 4. No matter which you choose, you’ll get the same good sound quality, microphone performance on voice calls, and IP54 water resistance. The more expensive pair has features that you might want, including active noise cancellation and a more advanced charging case (it supports Find My and wireless charging). You might be surprised by how well the noise cancellation works even with an unsealed design; it reduces office ambience and annoying hums, but louder sounds and voices still cut through the ANC, since these don’t use a sealed ear tip.\nIf you’re truly interested in noise-canceling earbuds, consider upgrading to the AirPods Pro 3. They offer much better audio quality, stronger ANC, and a better experience overall. I’d only steer you to the\nnoise-canceling AirPods 4\nif you’re\nreally\nopposed to ear tips.\nRead my full AirPods 4 review\n.\nThe best for those who prefer headphones\n8.5\nVerge Score\nAirPods Max (USB-C)\n$\n519\n$\n549\n5\n% off\n$\n519\nThe Good\nHigh-luxury design\nTerrific, balanced sound quality\nVery effective noise cancellation\nDependable and foolproof controls\nSpatial audio for immersive entertainment\nThe Bad\nHeavier than many competitors\nNo 3.5mm jack\nWired listening requires $35 cable\nCase is an abomination\nLacks latest AirPods Pro features\n$519 at Amazon\n$529 at Walmart\n$519 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nNoise cancellation:\nYes /\nBattery life:\n20 hours (ANC on) /\nWater resistance:\nNo /\nBluetooth codecs:\nAAC, SBC /\nMultipoint:\nNo\n/\nWorks best with:\niOS, Windows, macOS\nWe’ve gone back and forth recommending Apple’s $549 AirPods Max over the last few years. They have a standout design, but the good looks and premium feel come at a high cost. Not just that, these headphones are considerably heavier than most competitors and can get fatiguing over extended use. But the fabric ear cups on the AirPods Max are much more pleasant in warm weather than the pleather you’ll find on Bose and Sony products, and probably won’t leave you with sweaty ears.\nRelated\nHow to choose an Apple Watch\nWhy I love my Apple EarPods\nTurn your AirPods Max into a masterpiece with Casetify’s new headphone wrap\nThe AirPods Max provide impressive noise cancellation, and the transparency mode is clearer and more natural-sounding than any other set of headphones on the market. As for sound, Apple’s headphones have a pleasant sound signature that works well across a wide range of genres. They’re easy to listen to with an impressive soundstage for closed-back headphones.\nYou lose some features — like conversation awareness and adaptive audio — that are included on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4 with ANC; this is due to the AirPods Max having Apple’s older H1 chip. However, the company\nadded lossless audio over USB-C\nin April, meaning these headphones are capable of offering the richest audio fidelity of the entire lineup.\nRead my full AirPods Max (Lightning) review\n.\nWhat’s coming next\nWith Apple’s\nfall hardware event\nin the rearview mirror, we’re at a point where the company’s lineup seems settled. Apple doesn’t upgrade its entry-level AirPods line on an annual basis like some of its other products, and the Pro 3 just hit the market. Meanwhile, the AirPods Max have gone relatively unchanged since their release in 2020, with Apple\nadding a model that has a USB-C port, plus new colors, last year\n. Looking further into the future,\na report from last year\nclaimed Apple was exploring a camera-equipped AirPods concept paired with AI courtesy of Apple Intelligence.\nHow we test AirPods\nWe spend dozens of hours using AirPods products for our initial reviews, and that testing extends for weeks and months afterward. That’s where we assess sound quality, mic performance, and overall reliability. Where applicable, we try the active noise cancellation in a wide range of different environments and have put the hearing protection of the AirPods Pro through the paces at concerts. We also closely examine ecosystem benefits and how the AirPods and Apple’s other products work together.\nUpdate, September 29th:\nAdjusted pricing / availability, and added the AirPods Pro 3 as our top pick.

    "source": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has blocked an effort to pass legislation that would have extended data privacy protections for federal lawmakers and public officials to everyone in the United States.\nOn Monday night, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked the U.S. Senate for unanimous consent from fellow senators to pass his legislation,\nS.2850\n. Wyden’s bill, if passed, would have taken\nbipartisan-passed provisions\ndesigned to protect government officials, lawmakers, and their families from having their personal information sold or traded by data brokers, and extend them to every American and person living in the United States.\n“Members of Congress should not receive special treatment,” Wyden said on the Senate floor. “Our constituents deserve protection from violence, stalking, and other criminal threats.”\n“Protecting everyone is the most effective way to protect U.S. military and intelligence personnel, including undercover officers,” Wyden added, per\nthe congressional record\n.\nCruz was the sole objecting senator, who claimed without evidence that Wyden’s bill could disrupt law enforcement, “such as knowing where sexual predators are living.”\nData brokers are part of a worldwide multibillion-dollar industry of companies that profit from hoarding and selling access to huge amounts of Americans’ personal, financial, and granular location information, often collected from phones and other devices connected to the internet. This data gets sold,\nincluding to governments\n, who don’t need a warrant for commercially obtainable data.\nThe collection of huge banks of data also comes with its own risks, including\nsecurity lapses\nand\ndata breaches\n. Information bought by data brokers has been used to dox people, and in recent cases linked to the recent murders of two Minnesota state lawmakers, whose killer\nallegedly obtained their home addresses\nfrom data brokers.\nCruz also objected to a second piece of legislation that Wyden introduced soon after, which would have extended the protections for federal officials and lawmakers to state officials and their staff, as well as survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.\nIn response, Cruz said that he was “interested in expanding the protection to as wide a universe as is feasible, as is practicable, but that answer is not yet worked out.”\nTopics\ncybersecurity\n,\ndata brokers\n,\nGovernment & Policy\n,\nRon Wyden\n,\nSecurity\n,\nTed Cruz\nZack Whittaker\nSecurity Editor\nZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "summary": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has blocked an effort to pass legislation that would have extended data privacy protections for federal lawmakers and public officials to everyone in the United States.\nOn Monday night, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked the U.S. Senate for unanimous consent from fellow senators to pass his legislation,\nS.2850\n. Wyden’s bill, if passed, would have taken\nbipartisan-passed provisions\ndesigned to protect government officials, lawmakers, and their families from having their personal information sold or traded by data brokers, and extend them to every American and person living in the United States.\n“Members of Congress should not receive special treatment,” Wyden said on the Senate floor. “Our constituents deserve protection from violence, stalking, and other criminal threats.”\n“Protecting everyone is the most effective way to protect U.S. military and intelligence personnel, including undercover officers,” Wyden added, per\nthe congressional record\n.\nCruz was the sole objecting senator, who claimed without evidence that Wyden’s bill could disrupt law enforcement, “such as knowing where sexual predators are living.”\nData brokers are part of a worldwide multibillion-dollar industry of companies that profit from hoarding and selling access to huge amounts of Americans’ personal, financial, and granular location information, often collected from phones and other devices connected to the internet. This data gets sold,\nincluding to governments\n, who don’t need a warrant for commercially obtainable data.\nThe collection of huge banks of data also comes with its own risks, including\nsecurity lapses\nand\ndata breaches\n.

Pressure from viewers and advertisers likely played a major role in the reversal. But for Carr, the episode might reinforce his belief that station groups should have more influence over national programming.\nToday, Carr's FCC\nvoted\nto seek public comment on a\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking\n(NPRM) that could result in certain broadcast ownership limits being scrapped or changed. This includes the Local Radio Ownership Rule that \"limits the total number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a local market\" and the Local Television Rule that \"limits a single entity from owning more than two television stations in the same local market,\" the FCC said.\n\"In recent years, numerous online audio and video streaming services have emerged, fundamentally changing how broadcast radio and television compete in the media marketplace. Our broadcast ownership rules should reflect these changes,\" Carr said today.\nProtesters:\n“Fire Carr, the censorship czar”\nThe FCC is required to periodically evaluate whether the rules still serve the public interest. Carr criticized previous FCC leaders for not eliminating ownership rules.\n\"Indeed, just this year, the [US Court of Appeals for the] Eighth Circuit determined that the FCC acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it adopted the last Quadrennial Review order,\" Carr said. \"In doing so, the court emphasized the deregulatory nature of the Quadrennial Review provisions that Congress added to the statute. Ultimately,\nthe court vacated the FCC's decision\nto retain the 'top-four' rule, which prohibits a single entity from owning or controlling two of the top four television stations in a local market.\"\nToday's meeting was\nbriefly disrupted\nby protesters chanting, \"Fire Carr, the censorship czar.\"\nThe FCC is separately reviewing the national ownership cap that prevents a single entity from owning or controlling broadcast television stations that reach more than 39 percent of TV audience households in the United States. The agency issued a\npublic notice\nin June to seek public comment on potentially changing or eliminating the rule.\nSinclair, Nexstar, and other station owners\nurged the FCC\nto scrap the rule, saying there's no justification for a restriction affecting only broadcasters \"in a marketplace dominated by the likes of Google/YouTube, Amazon, Meta, and Netflix.\" Nexstar in particular is\nhoping for a change\nso it can complete a $6.2 billion purchase of Tegna.\nThe NPRM approved today also seeks comment on whether to eliminate the Dual Network Rule that effectively prohibits mergers involving the Big Four broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC).\nLocal stations “trapped in the middle”\nTechnically, the FCC is continuing the 2022 quadrennial review of broadcast ownership rules that started during the Biden administration. The FCC is required to review the rules every four years. But significant changes seem more likely under Carr, who has supported President Trump's ongoing war against national networks over supposed bias against conservatives.\nAnna Gomez, the only Democrat on the Republican-majority commission, criticized Carr's fight against ABC in her comments at today's FCC meeting. Carr's FCC \"seiz[ed] on a late-night comedian's comments as a pretext to punish speech it disliked\" in \"an act of clear government intimidation,\" she said.\nGomez said that \"corporate behemoths who own large swaths of local stations across the country\" continued blocking Kimmel for several days after the show returned \"because these billion-dollar media companies have business before the FCC. They will need regulatory approval of their transactions and are pushing to reduce regulatory guardrails so they can grow even bigger.\"\nLocal stations are \"trapped in the middle as these massive companies impose their will and their values upon local communities,\" Gomez continued. \"This precise example neatly encapsulates the danger of allowing vast and unfettered media consolidation. This could drastically alter the media ecosystem and the number of voices that are a part of it.\"\nNational ownership cap\nGomez didn't vote against today's action. She said the NPRM \"is required by statute\" and that she supports \"seeking comment on these very important issues.\" But Gomez said she's concerned about consolidation limiting the variety of news and viewpoints on local TV stations.\nCongress\nset the national ownership cap\nat 39 percent in 2004 and exempted the cap from the FCC's required quadrennial review of media ownership rules. There is debate over whether the FCC has the authority to eliminate the national limit, and Gomez argued that \"given the prior Congressional action, I believe that only Congress can raise the cap.\"\nThe FCC's \"regulatory structure is in large part based on a balance of power between national networks with incentives to serve national interests and local broadcasters with incentives to serve their local communities,\" Gomez said. That balance could be disrupted by a single company owning enough broadcast stations to reach the majority of US households, she said.\n\"In the past two weeks, the public has raised serious concerns that large station groups made programming decisions to serve their national corporate interests, not their communities of license,\" Gomez said. \"What is the impact of letting them get even bigger?\"\nJon Brodkin\nSenior IT Reporter\nJon Brodkin\nSenior IT Reporter\nJon is a Senior IT Reporter for Ars Technica.

Thankfully, there's still room for innovation in this space, as this week I came across the surprising Baseus PrimeTrip VD1 Pro.\nThe VD1 Pro has a unique trick up its sleeve: a tiny solar panel. Let's be clear, it's not enough to power the dash cam for continuous, on-the-road recording – there's an internal battery for that. No, what the solar panel can do is power a parking mode for up to two weeks.\nParking modes are a relatively recent thing in dash cams. They spark to life to record the evidence when motion and threats around your parked vehicle are detected, like bumps or break-ins. Typically, they're powered\nby hardwiring to your vehicle's battery\n.\nYou may like\nI’ve reviewed over 15 dash cams this last year, and Viofo’s A329 is the best of the bunch – here’s why\nI tested the Baseus Security S2 – a camera powered by a solar panel that rotates to follow the sun – and it really works\nCan I use dash cam footage in court? An expert explains why video clips are increasingly helping motorists with claims\nYou don't want to leave a dash cam hardwired into your parked vehicle for too long, though – eventually it'll drain the battery completely. However, the VD1 Pro potentially does away with the need for hardwiring, providing what its maker says is up to 14 days power for the parking mode, storing up to 20 recordings through the front and rear cameras.\nI can't believe a feature like this hasn't utilized before, especially given the position that most dash cams find themselves – on a windscreen with exposure to daylight.\nI personally prefer the simpler plug-and-play dash cams rather than fiddling with the mechanics and hardwiring for permanent installation, so points go to the VD1 Pro for that. But how does it fare in other areas?\n(Image credit: Baseus)\nIt's surprisingly cheap, too\nBaseus is better known for making power banks and\nsecurity cameras\n, so it makes sense that it could combine those worlds into a dash cam with an innovative power supply design.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nBeyond its solar skills, the VD1 Pro is a dual-channel dash cam, meaning there are front and rear cameras. The front camera shoots\n4K\nvideo with a particularly wide 170-degree field of view (most dash cams are 140-degrees), while the rear camera tops out at just 1080p.\nThe sensor tech is actually slightly basic compared to today's\nbest dash cams\n, so I don't have super high hopes for video quality. However, the VD1 Pro is on the cheaper side,\ncosting $139.99 at Amazon US\nat the time of writing. I can't see the VD1 Pro at\nAmazon\nUK yet, but it appears at other discount sites for a much lower price – buy at your own risk.\nElsewhere, the Baseus PrimeTrip VD1 Pro is packed with features, including voice control, 5GHz Wi-Fi 6 for quick file uploads, and a companion app for streaming, saving recordings, viewing GPS data, and receiving OTA updates – all in-car, not remotely, which is a shame.\nI'm yet to test the VD1 Pro so I can't comment on how well it holds up in the real world, but it has piqued my interest enough to check it out.\nFollow TechRadar on Google News\nand\nadd us as a preferred source\nto get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

If you don’t mind having the previous generation, though, you’ll save a lot of money on a larger Scribe.\nRead our review\n.\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nBrandon Russell\nClose\nBrandon Russell\nCommerce Writer\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nBrandon Russell\nDeals\nClose\nDeals\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nDeals\nSonos\nClose\nSonos\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSonos\nSpeakers\nClose\nSpeakers\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSpeakers\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nMicrosoft launches ‘vibe working’ in Excel and Word\nLogitech’s MX Master 4 adds haptic feedback, mostly just for fun\nAnker’s fastest airline-friendly power bank is now available\nAmazon finally did the damn hardware right\nMicrosoft is bringing its Windows engineering teams back together again\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.\nE-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.\nEditor's note (September 2025):\nAmazon announced a revamped family of\nKindle Scribe E Ink tablets\n. The\nKindle Scribe 3\nis thinner and lighter than its predecessor with faster page-turning and writing experiences. The\nKindle Scribe Colorsoft\nis the first full-color addition to the lineup, with a pen that will support writing in 10 colors and highlighting in five different shades. Both new Scribe tablets will be available in the US \"later this year.\" You can read our\nKindle Scribe Colorsoft hands on\nto get a first look, but we'll update this guide once we've had the chance to test out both new E Ink tablets.\nQuick Overview\nBest E Ink tablet for most people\nreMarkable 2\n$399 at reMarkable\nBest premium E Ink tablet\nreMarkable Paper Pro\n$629 at reMarkable\nBest e-reader E Ink tablet\nAmazon Kindle Scribe\nMore options\n$300 at Amazon\nBest E Ink tablet for writing and note-taking\nSupernote A6 X2\n$329 at Supernote\nAnother color-display option\nOnyx Boox Note Air4 C\nMore options\n$529 at Boox\nSee 3 more\nTable of contents\nBest E Ink tablets for 2025\nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\nBest E Ink tablets for 2025\nreMarkable\nBest E Ink tablet for most people\nreMarkable 2\nScreen size:\n10.3-inch |\nBattery life:\nTwo weeks |\nNetwork connectivity:\nWi-Fi |\nCapacity:\n8GB |\nIncluded stylus:\nNo, extra cost |\nSupported file types:\nPDF, EPUB\nThe\nlatest reMarkable tablet\nisn’t topping our list because it’s the most full-featured or even most interesting writing tablet we tested. Rather, it provides the best mix of features people will find useful in an e-paper device like this.\nWe’ll get into them all, but first, it’s worth mentioning build quality. The reMarkable 2 weighs less than one pound and is one of the sleekest E Ink tablets we tried. It has a 10.3-inch monochrome digital paper display that’s surrounded by beige-colored bezels, with the chunkiest portion at the bottom edge where you’d naturally grip it. There’s a slim silver bezel on the left side, which attaches to accessories like the folio case and the new\nType Folio keyboard\n. Hats off to reMarkable for making an E Ink tablet that feels right at home with all of your other fancy gadgets.\nLet’s start with the writing and reading experiences on the reMarkable 2, both of which are great. From the get go, scribbling, doodling and writing was a breeze. I tested out the Marker Plus, which has a built-in eraser, but both it and the standard Marker are tilt- and pressure sensitive pens, and require no batteries or charging. I observed basically no lag between my pressing down onto the reMarkable 2’s screen and lines showing up. The latency was so low that it felt the closest to actual pen-and-paper. But I will say that this is not unique among our top picks in this guide – almost all of the E Ink tablets I tested got this very crucial feature right.\nWhen it comes to reading, the reMarkable 2 supports PDFs and ePUBs, and you can add files to the device by logging into your reMarkable account on desktop or via the companion mobile app on your phone. You can also pair your Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox account with your reMarkable account and access files that way as well. That should be good enough for anyone who, say, reads a lot of academic papers or reviews many documents for work. It’ll be harder for people who purchase their ebooks from online marketplaces like the Kindle or Kobo stores, but there are other options for those.\nAnother fun way to get documents onto the reMarkable 2 is via the\nRead with reMarkable extension\nfor Google Chrome. After installing it and pairing your reMarkable account, you’ll be able to send articles you find online directly to your reMarkable 2 so you can check them out later. You can even customize these files to be sent as text only, which will let you change their format directly on your reMarkable, or as a PDF file. Regardless of which you choose, you’ll be able to mark up these articles as you would any other file on the E Ink tablet.\nI used this extension a lot and I enjoyed reading longform articles on the reMarkable 2 more than on my iPhone. Being able to underline, highlight and otherwise mark up those stories was more of a bonus than a necessity for me, but for others who glean sources from online materials will be better off for it.\nOverall, it’s pretty easy to get files onto the reMarkable 2 and it is possible to access them elsewhere when you may not be able to whip out the E Ink tablet. Those with a reMarkable Connect subscription will have the best experience, and it’s a nice perk that you get a one-year membership when you buy one. The $3-per-month (or $30-per-year) subscription provides the ability to edit existing notes and take new ones from anywhere using the desktop and mobile apps, plus unlimited cloud storage and syncing.\nThat said, I kept most of my testing local on the reMarkable 2 itself and was impressed by its ability to be a digital notebook without a steep learning curve. You can create different notebooks and “quick sheets” to organize your handwritten notes, and folders to make sense of imported files. You’ll find eight different brush types with which to mark up documents and take notes, along with customizable line thicknesses and “colors” (which just show up as shades on the tablet itself). You can even type wherever you want in a doc, and the reMarkable 2 can translate handwritten notes into machine-readable text with surprising accuracy.\nIt was no shock that the reMarkable 2 ended up having the best mix of features, along with a relatively low learning curve. The company was one of the first on the scene with a truly viable E Ink tablet back in 2017, and they’ve been refining the experience ever since. But that comes at a cost – the reMarkable 2 isn’t the most expensive E Ink tablet we tested, but it’s not cheap either. The tablet will set you back $399 with the standard Marker, or $449 for a bundle with the Marker Plus. You could get a\n10th-gen iPad\nand the\nUSB-C Apple Pencil\nfor around the same price and you’d have a more flexible duo, purely based on the capabilities of iOS.\nBut you’re probably not considering an iPad for a specific reason, whether that’s your love for E Ink or the feeling of pen-to-paper writing, or you simply want a more distraction-free experience. If you’re looking for an E Ink tablet that will not take ages to get used to, offers a stellar writing experience and makes it relatively simple to access notes elsewhere, the reMarkable 2 is your best bet.\nPros\nGreat reading and writing experience\nGoogle Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox support\nEasy to use\nCons\nMarker costs extra\nExpensive\nUnlimited cloud storage comes with a subscription cost\n$399 at reMarkable\nEngadget\nBest premium E Ink tablet\nreMarkable Paper Pro\nRead our full\nreMarkable Paper Pro review\nScreen size:\n11.8-inch |\nBattery life:\nTwo weeks |\nNetwork connectivity:\nWi-Fi |\nCapacity:\n64GB |\nIncluded stylus:\nNo, extra cost |\nSupported file types:\nPDF, EPUB\nReMarkable upped the ante in basically every way with the\nPaper Pro\n, without sacrificing anything we loved about the reMarkable 2. Both my colleague Dan Cooper and I tested out the new device and you can read his full\nreMarkable Paper Pro review\nhere, which goes in-depth into the Paper Pro’s achievements and shortcomings. In my testing, I was most impressed by the refined design, faster response times and small joys that came from having a new color display.\nThe $629 Paper Pro has an 11.8-inch display, which is slightly larger and taller than that of the reMarkable 2. It’s not cumbersome, though, and with its 5.1mm thickness, it gets really close to the legal-pad notebook size I personally love. It feels quite premium on its own, especially with the new grooved edges, and even with its Folio protector, it stays quite svelte. The reMarkable 2 certainly isn’t an ogre by comparison, but the “pro” in the Paper Pro’s name is well-deserved.\nInside the reMarkable Paper Pro is a 1.8GHz quad-core Cortex A53 processor, 2GB of RAM and 64GB of storage — all of which are specs that have been bumped up from the reMarkable 2. It truly makes a difference in the performance of the new model. The Pro feels zippier than the reMarkable 2: page refreshes are quicker, actions and transitions are more smooth and pen latency is only 12ms (almost undetectable in my experience).\nWhere you see the gears working most often is in the use of color. The Paper Pro’s screen uses a modified version of E Ink’s Gallery 3 technology called Canvas Color, which is capable of producing 20,000 colors that can layer on top of each other (think when you highlight a line more than once using two different colors over one another). You can actually see the pixels turning from a standard black color to the color of your choosing when you’re scribbling in a note, which isn’t a bad thing because the screen doesn’t lag or freeze because of this — write at your own speed and the device will up and produce the right colors as you go along.\nAs for software, you’re getting the same experience as you would with the reMarkable 2, which is to stay a pretty streamlined interface that makes it easy to organize all of your documents, notes and other reading and writing material. The reMarkable 2 offered one of the most approachable software experiences in an E Ink tablet, and that continues here on the Paper Pro. These devices prioritize a distraction-free environment — or at the very least, a lower-distraction zone — and I appreciate how reMarkable has kept its devices’ interface simple and straightforward.\nArguably the biggest caveat to any reMarkable tablet remains the monthly Connection subscription — an optional $3 monthly or $30 annually service that provides unlimited cloud storage, device syncing and the ability to create and edit notes in reMarkable mobile apps. Power users will likely find it worthwhile to pay for Connect, but the Paper Pro’s 64GB of internal storage might be enough for others who want to keep it simple (and keep all of their activity to the Paper Pro itself). New device owners get a 100-day free trial, so it’s easy enough to give Connect a shot and then cancel if you don’t find yourself using all of its perks.\nThe most important thing to remember if you’re considering a reMarkable tablet is that, based on our testing, both the reMarkable 2 and reMarkable Paper Pro are solid devices. The Paper Pro certainly earned its “pro” moniker thanks to noticeable improvements the company made, but those do not negate how good of a device the reMarkable 2 still is. But if you’ve got the cash and want to invest in a luxury E Ink tablet experience, the Paper Pro is the way to go.\nPros\nColor is a welcome and useful addition\nBacklight lets you work in dark environments\nVastly improved performance\nCons\nExpensive\n$629 at reMarkable\nPhoto by Cherlynn Low / Engadget\nBest e-reader E Ink tablet\nAmazon Kindle Scribe\nScreen size:\n10.2-inch |\nBattery life:\nMonths |\nNetwork connectivity:\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth |\nCapacity:\nUp to 64GB |\nIncluded stylus:\nYes |\nSupported file types:\nAZW3, AZW, TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively and\nmore\nYou really have two options in this space: the\nAmazon Kindle Scribe\nand the\nKobo Elipsa 2E\n. The Scribe edged out the Elipsa 2E purely because of its low-latency pen-and-screen combination. The Elipsa has its merits, which we’ll get into in a bit, but it just couldn’t compete with the Scribe when it came to a seamless and smooth handwriting experience.\nWe already gave the Kindle Scribe the\nfull review treatment\nand\ntested out the latest Kindle Scribe\n, which incorporates more AI features. As mentioned, there’s little to no latency when writing on the Scribe with its companion pen. Thanks to the\nlatest software update\n, you also have more brush types to choose from now, including fountain pen, marker and pencil, which add to the charm. Like other E Ink tablets, the Scribe makes it easy to create multiple notebooks, and you can add pages to them and change up their templates if you wish.\nAs an e-reader, the Scribe shines not only thanks to its 10.2-inch touchscreen with auto-adjusting front lights, but also because you have Amazon’s entire ebook store at your fingertips. If you get most of your reading material from Amazon or subscribe to\nKindle Unlimited\n, you’ll be able to jump right into all of your titles instantly on the Scribe just as you would on a device like the Kindle Paperwhite. In addition, the Scribe can connect to Audible via Bluetooth for audiobook listening. It’s also easy to get ebooks from your local library and read them on a Kindle. This will be crucial not only for voracious readers, but especially for students who buy or rent digital textbooks and those who consume books regularly for research purposes.\nI thought about students a lot when using the Scribe. I started college in 2009, two years after the first Kindle was released and one year before the first iPad came out. Getting textbooks digitally really wasn’t an option for me – but I can understand the appeal a note-taking device like the Kindle Scribe would have for students. It’s arguably even better than a standard Kindle because of its bigger screen size, which will make it less tiring to stare at for long periods of time. Adding the ability to take handwritten notes while you’re studying is icing on the cake.\nHowever, Amazon’s execution of book notes is not my favorite. You cannot make annotations in the margins of Kindle ebooks. Instead you press and hold the pen’s tip on the screen to highlight text or add a note to a particular word or phrase. If you do the latter, a window pops up on the bottom half of the screen where you can either take a handwritten note or type a text note using the Scribe’s mildly frustrating and sluggish on-screen keyboard.\nAmazon rectified this a bit with a\nsoftware update\nthat allows for direct on-page writing in certain Kindle books. The Kindle Store now has a section that showcases \"Write-on Books,\" which is currently mostly made up of journals and game books that feature puzzles like crosswords and sudoku. This is certainly a step in the right direction, but it means you still won't be able to mark up your favorite fiction and non-fiction books until they support the new feature.\nThis is where I give a nod to the\nKobo Elipsa 2E\n, where you\ncan\nwrite notes in the margins, underline, circle and otherwise mark up your reading material. It’s a more natural (and fun) experience since it mimics what you’d do if you were reading a physical book. It’s a shame that the latency on the\nElipsa\nwas just a hair more noticeable than that of the Scribe. If it weren’t for that, it might have beaten Amazon’s device here.\nWhat that extra bit of latency translates to in practice is handwriting that can come out just a bit messier, and that increases precipitously the faster you write. But that also means that you’ll notice this the most when taking notes longhand on the Elipsa; if you’re primarily using an E Ink tablet to mark up documents, it won’t affect you as much.\nDespite that, I did like the way Kobo executed notebooks on the Elipsa. You can have a standard notebook where you can write and scribble away, or an “advanced” notebook that supports handwriting-to-text conversion and inserting things like diagrams and formulas. Text conversion is actually pretty accurate, too, even when dealing with some of my ugliest handwriting. Kobo also has a pretty sizable ebook marketplace, so it’s certainly a decent option if you want to stay clear of the Amazon ecosystem.\nPros\nBasic pen included in cost\nSeamlessly integrates with Kindle books\nLow-latency writing experience\nCons\nWriting in margins limited to certain books\nInelegant notebook experience\n$300 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$300 at Target\n$300 at Best Buy\nSupernote\nBest E Ink tablet for writing and note-taking\nSupernote A6 X2\nScreen size:\n7.8-inch |\nBattery life:\nWeeks |\nNetwork connectivity:\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth |\nCapacity:\n32GB, expandable up to 2TB with microSD card |\nIncluded stylus:\nNo, extra cost |\nSupported file types:\nPDF, EPUB, Word, Text (.txt), PNG, JPG, Comic book archive (.cbz), FictionBook2 (.fb2) and OpenXPS (.xps)\nSupernote impressed me with its X tablet when I first tested it and now the company is on the X2 version. The\nA6 X2 model\nhas a 7.8-inch screen, and the recently released\nManta A5 X2\nhas a 10.7-inch display. I’ve tried both out at this point and the main difference, as one might expect, is screen size.\nBut before we get into a\ncomparison\nof the two Supernote devices, let’s talk about the upgrades the company made to both recently. With the Nomad X2, the design has been tweaked in subtle ways from the original Supernote I tested. You get the updated FeelWrite 2 screen protector experience, which is a smoother, less scratchy one than other E Ink tablets, and a plastic body that’s pretty lightweight. There are dual sidebars, sections on both long edges of the tablet that, when swiped, bring up a menu, making this version easier for right- and left-handed users alike. The software auto-rotates when you flip the screen, too. On top of that, both the Nomad and Manta X2 devices are user-repairable now with replaceable batteries and a microSD card slot, both of which you can see on the backside of the tablet thanks to its clear panel (there’s an opaque, white option too that’s also just as upgradeable but nowhere near as futuristic looking).\nUnsurprisingly, this is still the most fun I had using any E Ink tablet. Thanks to its support of a range of file formats (PDF, ePUB, Word, PNG, JPG, etc), you can put plenty of material onto the X2 and do what you like with it. In my previous experiments, I wanted to see if I could treat it almost like a digital bullet journal, and that wasn’t hard to do. There are built-in page templates, but I was able to download daily, weekly and monthly planner templates online, resize them and move them onto the X2 using Android File Transfer. The device has a dedicated “MyStyle” folder where you can save files you want to use as templates. The most difficult part was making sure I had the dimensions right while resizing the documents. Once saved in the right folder, I could make an entire notebook out of the templates I had gotten from the internet for free.\nBut you don’t have to get that deep if you don’t want to; Supernote’s software comes with a number of built-in note templates that are more than suitable for a range of situations and scenarios. The device still has its own app store, but it’s pretty sparse, save for the Kindle app (although, the last thing I wanted to do on the Supernote was read) and the\nnew Atelier painting app\n. The latter is described by the company as “professional painting software” that has a number of different brush options, marker and spray tools, 16 levels of grayscale color and the option to export your creations as PSD files so you can take them to the next level in Photoshop. It’s a fun take on a more artistic notebook of sorts, and those who find themselves wanting to separate their artistic creations from their mostly-words notes will appreciate the inclusion.\nThis device really shines as an E Ink notebook and the company clearly put a lot of thought into “building a better mousetrap,” so to speak. You can translate handwritten words into typed text, but you don’t have to do that in order for the software to recognize your handwriting. There’s a keywords feature that lets you basically bookmark important phrases for quick access later. All you need to do is lasso the word, press the keyword button and the tablet’s software will translate your writing into typed text. Then you can add it as a keyword and quickly jump back to it from the left-side tablet of contents menu. Similarly, you can bookmark titles and add stars to pages that are important, all of which help you jump between important bits.\nThat said, a Supernote device is similar to one from Onyx Boox in that it’s not going to hold your hand. You have to be ready to play around, mess with settings and generally tinker with it right when you open the box, and some will be\njust fine doing that\n(like our own weekend editor Cheyenne MacDonald). The software isn’t as polished as that on devices made by Amazon or Kobo, which leads to an unavoidable learning curve. But notebook nerds like myself will be thrilled with all that the Supernote Nomad has to offer.\nThat said, this isn’t the most expensive E Ink tablet on our list, but it will set you back $329 or more: $329 for the Nomad A6 X2 or $505 for the Manta X2, and $89 (or more) for an accompanying pen. Which size you choose will ultimately depend on personal preference. The Nomad, as its name suggests, is the more portable of the two and feels more like interacting with a paperback book (albeit a very thin one), whereas the Manta gives you noticeably more screen real estate. If you know you’ll do a lot of writing on this device, consider your handwriting sizer — those who default to cursive or big, loopy print may find a more spacious companion in the Manta.\nPros\nExcellent writing experience\nTons of notebook customization options\nGood handwriting recognition\nCons\nPen comes at an added cost\nNo backlight\n$329 at Supernote\nOnyx Boox\nAnother color-display option\nOnyx Boox Note Air4 C\nScreen size:\n10.3-inch |\nBattery life:\nWeeks |\nNetwork connectivity:\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth |\nCapacity:\n64GB |\nIncluded stylus:\nYes |\nSupported file types:\nPDF, PPT, EPUB, TXT, DJVU, HTML, RTF, FB2, DOC, MOBI, CHM, PNG, JPG, TIFF, BMP\nOnxy continues to iterate on its lineup of E Ink tablets with the\nNote Air4 C\n, a tablet that looks and feels almost identical to the Air3 C, but now it’s slightly less weighty (literally 10g lighter than its predecessor), includes two extra gigabytes of RAM and runs Android 13.\nI experienced little to no latency when writing on the Boox Note Air and I was happy with the number of brush options it has in the Notebook app. Thanks to the color E Ink display, now you can even add and save a few different brushes with colored ink, line thickness and other specifics and quickly switch between them. This is particularly useful on a color E Ink tablet like this because you can save, say, black, red and blue brushes to use to differentiate different types of notes and switching among them is super quick. You can also now add different shapes to notes and fill them in with color; I made something that resembled a sticky note using a simple square filled in with yellow. The most visual learners among us will find features like this very helpful.\nLike the Supernote A6 X2, this tablet comes with a bunch of page templates you can use for note-taking (including some color options now as well), or you can bring in your own PDFs and other documents to use as templates. There’s an “AI recognition” feature that translates a whole page’s handwriting into typed text, and it’s actually pretty accurate. (Though, it did consistently confuse my “&” for a capital A). I also appreciated that you can add other kinds of material to your notes, including web pages and voice recordings, and share notes as PDFs or PNGs via email, Google Drive and other services. Features like those ensure that, with this partially analog device, you don’t miss out on some of the conveniences that a true digital notebook system would have.\nThe fact remains that Boox’s entire Note series is what you’d get if you removed some of the notebook-specific features from the Supernote A6 X2 and added in a more complete version of Android. Boox makes a number of interesting E Ink devices and the Boox Note Air is the one that best compares to the others on our list thanks to its 10.3-inch display. They are E Ink Android tablets, so that means you can actually download Android apps from the Google Play Store like Kindle, Kobo and others. There’s even a web browser, and yes, you can watch videos on this thing, too.\nOf course, just because you can do all of that doesn’t mean you should. E Ink screens are truly best for reading and writing, so I didn’t spend much time binge watching YouTube on Boox’s device – but I was happy that I had the freedom to do so. Really, the utility of Android comes in with the app store and I expect that most people will use it to download all of their favorite reading and writing apps. Much like a standard tablet, this will be a great option for anyone that gets their reading material from a bunch of different places — and since you can manually transfer documents from your computer to the device, too, it’s far-and-away the most versatile option on our list.\nAnd, importantly, Boox tablets in general offer an interesting value proposition. A Boox Note Air4 C bundle with the tablet, a standard pen and a folio case comes in at $529, putting it on the higher end of the price spectrum among the devices we tested. But considering it’s a full Android tablet, that doesn’t seem absurd. Those who want to avoid distractions most of the time while still having access to email and a web browser might gravitate towards a device like this.\nPros\nColor E Ink display\nRuns Android 13 with access to Google Play Store\nSupports many ways to add files to the device\nStylus included in the box\nCons\nE Ink screen hinders it from being a good video-consumption device\nNot as user-friendly as others\nOn the expensive side\n$529 at Boox\nExplore More Buying Options\n$510 at Amazon\nPhoto by Valentina Palladino / Engadget\nA big-screen option\nOnyx Boox Note Max\nScreen size:\n13.3-inch |\nBattery life:\nWeeks |\nNetwork connectivity:\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth |\nCapacity:\n128GB |\nIncluded stylus:\nYes |\nSupported file types:\nPDF, PPT, EPUB, TXT, DJVU, HTML, RTF, FB2, DOC, MOBI, CHM, PNG, JPG, TIFF, BMP\nMost E Ink tablets available now max out at 10 or 11 inches in screen size. But the latest model from Boox, the\nNote Max\n, has a gloriously large 13.3-inch Carta 1300 display. It’s not the only E Ink tablet from Boox to get this big — the\nTab X\nhas the same size screen, albeit with a lower dpi (207 vs the Note Max’s 300) — but it is one of the few e-paper tablets with such a large display made by an established manufacturer in this space.\nAside from the luxurious display, the Note Max feels and works like any other tablet in the Note series so get ready to tinker with it if this is your first such Android-based device. But I found the note-taking and doodling experience to be remarkable on such a large e-paper display. I’m someone who prefers large notebooks (B5-sized and larger, A4 or legal-pad sized preferred) so it’s not surprising that I was drawn to the Note Max.\nOne of the native Boox apps I particularly loved using in this large-format device was Calendar Memo, which gives you a month-view calendar that you can tap into individual days and take notes that correspond to that day. So for example, you can take work notes, journal, write down to-do lists and more and return to those writings even after the day has passed just by tapping on a specific day in the calendar. And if you use Boox’s native ereading app, the books and documents you read on each day will also show up with your notes, providing a handy log of your progress. Not only did I find it useful to have all of that information in one viewport thanks to the huge display, but I could also see myself using the Calendar Memo app regularly to log all of the most important things I want to remember long-term for each day.\nThat said, the Note Max doesn’t come cheap: it’s $689 for the tablet, plus the included cover and stylus. While it’s great that Boox doesn’t make you pay extra for those much-needed accessories, it’s still likely too cost-prohibitive for most people.\nPros\nSharp E Ink Carta 1300 display\nLuxe 13.3-inch screen size\nRuns Android 13 with access to the Google Play Store\nComes with an included stylus and cover\nCons\nNo front light\nNot as user-friendly as other options\nExpensive\n$689 at Boox\nExplore More Buying Options\n$650 at Amazon\nDaniel Cooper for Engadget\nHonorable mention\nreMarkable Paper Pro Move\nScreen size:\n7.3-inch |\nBattery life:\nTwo weeks |\nNetwork connectivity:\nWi-Fi |\nCapacity:\n64GB |\nIncluded stylus:\nYes |\nSupported file types:\nPDF, EPUB\nIf you like the idea of the reMarkable Paper Pro but either want something smaller or cheaper (or both), the new\nPaper Pro Move\nwas basically made for you. With its 7.3-inch Canvas Color display, it resembles a\nsteno-pad version\nof the full-sized Paper Pro. It’s most similar in size to the Supernote Nomad, but the Paper Pro Move is slightly smaller in width and height, which should allow it to slip into wide pockets more easily.\nThe hardware is top-notch just like the regular Paper Pro, with solid, ridged edges and a luxe screen that provides good feedback when you write on it. Its marker attaches magnetically to the right side of the device for charging and safe keeping, and you can optionally get a folio case for the Paper Pro Move that will protect the screen when you’re not using it and secure the marker even further.\nSoftware is identical here to the regular Paper Pro as well, with a few new added features like a drag-and-drop toolbar, note search and handwriting-to-text conversion that will be available across other reMarkable tablets. In addition, you can create all manner of notebooks for handwritten text and upload documents using reMarkable’s mobile app and web client. The device supports PDFs and EPUB files, which limits things a bit if you were hoping to use this like a ereader. There are better E Ink tablets for that purpose; the Paper Pro Move, just like the regular tablet, is best for handwriting notes, marking up documents and the like. And thanks to its size, it’ll likely be much better for those who work on location or in the field, rather than at a desk.\nThe price is also a bit more manageable than the full-sized Paper Pro. The Move will run you $449 when paired with its standard marker, but if you want the upgraded marker and want to add the folio case into the mix, be prepared to spend more. Still, $449 is a better starting price than the regular Paper Pro’s $629 floor.\nPros\nCompact size\nExcellent build quality\nGood battery life\nCons\nOn the expensive side for a small tablet\nNo keyboard folio option; limited to on-screen keyboard\n$449 at reMarkable\nPhoto by Amy Skorheim / Engadget\nHonorable mention\nKobo Libra Colour\nScreen size:\n7-inch |\nBattery life:\nUp to 40 days |\nNetwork connectivity:\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth |\nCapacity:\n32GB |\nIncluded stylus:\nNo |\nSupported file types:\nEPUB, EPUB3, FlePub, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, TIFF, TXT, HTML, RTF, CBZ, CBR, Kobo audiobooks\nThe\nKobo Libra Colour\nnot only adds color to its screen but also stylus support. That means you can highlight text, write in the margins of e-books and create notebooks. The low-latency, feature-rich stylus, plus integration with Dropbox and Google Drive, make the Libra Colour a surprisingly effective E Ink tablet. Ultimately, we still think the Kindle Scribe is your best bet for a tablet-and-ereader combo, thanks to the more expansive Kindle library and the larger, ten-inch screen — but Kobo’s latest deserves a mention.\nThe Libra Colour is our current pick for a model with buttons in\nour ereader guide\n. It has a premium build, plenty of text customizations for comfortable reading and a crisp, warm-light, seven-inch display. The addition of color adds interest to book covers and lets you highlight text in four different hues. Kobo also stuck a faster processor in the device, which makes waking from sleep, turning pages, navigating the menu and changing orientation zippy fast.\nThe Libra Colour doesn’t come with the Kobo stylus — another point in the Scribe’s favor — but if you add the $70 accessory, you’ll be able to highlight text and scribble notes in the margins of any book. You’ll also unlock access to Kobo’s two styles of notebooks: Basic, which lets you draw, scribble and write freehand, and Advanced, which can convert handwriting to typed text and lets you add diagrams and sections.\nThe stylus offers three pen styles, plus a brush and highlighter, and switching between them is quick with an unobtrusive menu. Thanks to the color technology, you can write and draw in ten colors and highlight in four. One of the few issues I ran into was with the highlighter button — it’s in a great spot for spotlighting text on the fly, but that location is also right where I rest my pointer finger, so I often hit it while writing. But the utility of the built-in eraser balances out that irritation.\nI noticed a barely perceptible latency and good pressure sensitivity, which is most obvious using the fountain pen. The tap-to-convert feature almost always correctly turned my weird printing-and-cursive-hybrid handwriting into type, and uploading notebooks to Dropbox or Google Drive took mere seconds. (You can also do hardwired, USB-C transfers to a computer.)\nWith the added cost of the stylus, you’ll pay $300 for Kobo’s set, which is still $100 cheaper than the base model of the latest Kindle Scribe. If you don’t need a larger screen or access to the hundreds of Kindle titles you may have already purchased, the Libra Colour makes for an appealing ereader/E Ink tablet alternative.\n— Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter\nPros\nColor display\nLow-latency stylus performance\nCan write in the margins of any ebook\nCons\nSmaller screen\nStylus costs extra\n$229 at Kobo\nExplore More Buying Options\n$229 at Amazon\nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\nAn E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.\nThe final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nArguably the biggest reason why you\nwouldn’t\nwant to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.\nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\nWriting and latency\nArguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.\nReading\nHow much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).\nThe supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the\nKindle\nor Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAlso with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to\nbring those titles over to a third-party device\n. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.\nSearch functionality\nMost E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.\nSearching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.\nSharing and connectivity\nWhile we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nNone of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet\nafter\nthe tablet portion is done.\nPrice\nE Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.\nE Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”\nAs a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.\nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\nOnyx Boox Tab X C\nThe\nBoox Tab X C\nis a color-screened version of the Tab X, the company’s all-purpose e-paper Android tablet. The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet.\nLenovo Smart Paper\nLenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the\nSmart Paper\n, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.\nOnyx Boox Tab Ultra\nThe\nBoox Tab Ultra\nhas a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",

After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.\nE-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.\nEditor's note (September 2025):\nAmazon announced a revamped family of\nKindle Scribe E Ink tablets\n.

OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls \"cameos.\"\nOpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.\nRegarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls \"sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.\" In May, Google's\nVeo 3\nbecame the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released\nWan 2.5\n, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.\nOpenAI demonstrates Sora 2's capabilities in a launch video.\nThe model also features notable visual consistency improvements over OpenAI's previous video model, and it can also follow more complex instructions across multiple shots while maintaining coherency between them. The new model represents what OpenAI describes as its \"GPT-3.5 moment for video,\" comparing it to the ChatGPT breakthrough during the evolution of its text-generation models over time.\nSora 2 appears to demonstrate improved physical accuracy over the original Sora model from\nFebruary 2024\n, with OpenAI claiming the model can now simulate complex physical movements like Olympic gymnastics routines and triple axels while maintaining realistic physics. Last year, shortly after the launch of Sora 1 Turbo,\nwe saw\nseveral notable failures of similar video-generation tasks that OpenAI claims to have addressed with the new model.\n\"Prior video models are overoptimistic—they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt,\" OpenAI wrote in its announcement. \"For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard.\"\nAn AI-generated video of vikings with sound, created using OpenAI Sora 2.\nAn AI-generated video of vikings with sound, created using OpenAI Sora 2.\nWe haven't had a chance to evaluate Sora 2 yet, but we will likely test it in a future article.\nPast experience\nwith video-synthesis models suggests caution about\nclaims of building \"world models\"\nthat accurately model physics. Despite marketing language about modeling reality, these remain Transformer-based AI models that fundamentally work by pattern-matching training examples to produce outputs, however novel those outputs may appear.\nHowever, with enough video examples and high-quality training techniques, a video-synthesis model can likely build what\nwe once\ncalled an \"illusion of understanding\" that is convincing enough to visually simulate a large portion of reality in various situations without actually \"understanding\" physics, so to speak.\nOpenAI itself acknowledges that Sora 2 \"makes plenty of mistakes\" but views the model as validation that scaling neural networks on video data will bring the company closer to its goal of simulating reality. The company positions Sora 2 as progress toward \"general-purpose world simulators and robotic agents\" that it believes will \"fundamentally reshape society.\"\nA different approach to social media\nAside from visual and auditory upgrades, OpenAI is taking another big step away from its AI research lab pedigree toward making the new model available to average people in an easy-to-use way. It's doing it by packaging Sora 2 into a\nsocial iOS app\nthat focuses on creating and sharing AI-generated content.\nThat new iOS app has already launched in the US and Canada as an invite-based rollout, with plans to expand to additional countries. Users can sign up in the app for notifications when access becomes available for their account. The service will initially be free with what OpenAI describes as \"generous limits,\" though the company plans to offer paid options for additional generations when demand exceeds available compute resources.\nUsing the app, users can create videos, remix content from other users, and browse a customizable feed of generated videos. As mentioned above, the app's Cameo feature allows users to essentially deepfake themselves by recording a one-time video and audio capture, which the model can then insert into any Sora-generated scene.\nAn AI-generated video of a gymnast doing flips, which is a notable improvement over Sora 1.\nAn AI-generated video of a gymnast doing flips, which is a notable improvement over Sora 1.\nIn addition to the basic Sora 2 model on the website and in the app, ChatGPT Pro subscribers will gain access to Sora 2 Pro, described as an experimental higher-quality model. OpenAI also plans to release Sora 2 through its API for developers. The older\nSora 1 Turbo\nmodel will remain available, and existing creations will stay in users' Sora libraries.\nNew challenges ahead\nSo, what could go wrong with an app that can easily put people into AI-generated videos? Well, just about everything. Battling misuse is likely going to be a tricky issue for the company. In the recent past, we've seen instances of AI deepfaking (not related to OpenAI) without consent that have led to\nbullying lawsuits\n,\ncriminal penalties\n, and\nsuicides\n.\nOpenAI is taking precautions. Given recently prominent corporate sensitivities following a\nChatGPT user's suicide\n, OpenAI says Sora 2 includes specific protections for teenage users. Those include default daily-generation limits and strict permissions for the cameos feature. OpenAI says it has deployed both automated safety systems and human moderators to review potential cases of bullying or misuse.\nIn particular, OpenAI has built in layers of security for the cameos feature. It says that users can maintain control over their uploaded likeness: They can decide who can use their cameo in videos and can revoke access or remove videos containing their likeness at any time. Users can also view all videos containing their cameo, including drafts created by other people.\nBeyond deepfakes, the new Sora app has another hurdle to clear. These days, social media is\noften seen\nas less than a positive thing due to its perceived broad effects on society. Perhaps reacting to this stigma, OpenAI claims it has designed the new app to avoid common social media pitfalls like doomscrolling and addiction with what it calls a \"new class of recommender algorithms\" that users can control through natural language instructions, rather than relying on traditional engagement metrics.\n\"We are not optimizing for time spent in feed, and we explicitly designed the app to maximize creation, not consumption,\" OpenAI stated in its announcement.\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\nBenj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

    "source": "The Department of Energy said Wednesday night it was canceling 321 awards worth $7.56 billion that were largely focused on clean energy.\nThe agency hasn’t publicly released a list of the affected projects and, at the time of publication, it had not provided one to TechCrunch. According to E&E News and Heatmap, which have obtained the list, the majority of the cuts have hit states that went for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, though some were in “red” states that voted for President Trump.\nDirect air capture and hydrogen hub projects appear to have been wiped out as a result. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that one of the canceled projects included $1.2 billion for the state’s hydrogen hub, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, and E&E News is\nreporting\nthat hubs in Texas and Louisiana were also on the chopping block.\nAt least 10 direct air capture (DAC) projects totaling $47.3 million were cut, though those in Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, and North Dakota have survived. The oil and gas industry has been supportive of DAC projects because the captured CO\n2\ncan be injected into underperforming oil wells to boost production.\nOther states affected by the billions in canceled contracts include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.\nThe Harris-voting states with canceled projects were confirmed in a\ntweet\nfrom Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He teased the cancellations earlier yesterday in an apparent effort to deepen partisanship during the shutdown, adding that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”\nAll 16 states that he listed voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, and many are controlled by Democrats at the state level.

Last week, the Department of Energy\nbanned staffers from using certain words\n, including “climate change” and “emissions.”\nIn May, the agency canceled $3.7 billion worth of clean energy and manufacturing awards. Those cancellations spanned a broad list of industries, from metal manufacturing and cement companies to power plant operators and chemical plants run by fossil fuel giants.\nThe Trump administration’s aggressive cancellations have prompted many awardees to sue the government to retain the awards. The Environmental Protection Agency, which was quick to cancel contracts worth $20 billion, has been an\nearly target\nof legal action. So far, the plaintiffs have had mixed success.\nWhile a\nfederal district court said\nthe EPA’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious,” an appellate court\nruled in favor of the agency\n, saying that the contract cancellations were valid and showed the government exercising “proper oversight and management.”\nIn the instance of the recent DOE cancellations, several award recipients have already appealed the decision, the agency confirmed.\nUpdate: The article and headline have been updated to include further details about which states and programs are affected.\nTopics\nARPA-E\n,\nClimate\n,\nDepartment of Energy\n,\nGovernment & Policy\n,\nHydrogen\n,\nTrump Administration\nTim De Chant\nSenior Reporter, Climate\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "summary": "The Department of Energy said Wednesday night it was canceling 321 awards worth $7.56 billion that were largely focused on clean energy.\nThe agency hasn’t publicly released a list of the affected projects and, at the time of publication, it had not provided one to TechCrunch. According to E&E News and Heatmap, which have obtained the list, the majority of the cuts have hit states that went for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, though some were in “red” states that voted for President Trump.\nDirect air capture and hydrogen hub projects appear to have been wiped out as a result. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that one of the canceled projects included $1.2 billion for the state’s hydrogen hub, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, and E&E News is\nreporting\nthat hubs in Texas and Louisiana were also on the chopping block.\nAt least 10 direct air capture (DAC) projects totaling $47.3 million were cut, though those in Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, and North Dakota have survived. The oil and gas industry has been supportive of DAC projects because the captured CO\n2\ncan be injected into underperforming oil wells to boost production.\nOther states affected by the billions in canceled contracts include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.\nThe Harris-voting states with canceled projects were confirmed in a\ntweet\nfrom Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He teased the cancellations earlier yesterday in an apparent effort to deepen partisanship during the shutdown, adding that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”\nAll 16 states that he listed voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, and many are controlled by Democrats at the state level.

Failure to accept the bargain would result in a withdrawal of federal programs that would likely cripple most universities. The offer, sent to a mixture of state and private universities, would see the government dictate everything from hiring and admissions standards to grading and has provisions that appear intended to make conservative ideas more welcome on campus.\nThe document was sent to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Virginia. However, independent reporting indicates that the administration will ultimately extend the deal to all colleges and universities.\nArs has obtained a copy of the proposed \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" which makes the scope of the bargain clear in its introduction. \"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" it suggests, while mentioning that those benefits include access to fundamental needs, like student loans, federal contracts, research funding, tax benefits, and immigration visas for students and faculty.\nIt is difficult to imagine how it would be possible to run a major university without access to those programs, making this less a compact and more of an ultimatum.\nPoorly thought through\nThe Compact itself would see universities agree to cede admissions standards to the federal government. The government, in this case, is demanding only the use of \"objective\" criteria such as GPA and standardized test scores as the basis of admissions decisions, and that schools publish those criteria on their websites. They would also have to publish anonymized data comparing how admitted and rejected students did relative to these criteria.\nThe micromanaging of admissions extends to foreign students, as the document warns that admitting them risks \"saturating the campus with noxious values such as anti-Semitism and other anti-American values, creating serious national security risks.\" So every campus will have to cap foreign admissions at 15 percent of the student population. Those who are accepted will need to sit through instruction on American civics.\nAt the same time, the document is clearly calling for an affirmative action program for conservative ideas. \"Signatories to this compact commit themselves to fostering a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus,\" the Compact reads. \"A vibrant marketplace of ideas requires an intellectually open campus environment, with a broad spectrum of ideological viewpoints present and no single ideology dominant, both along political and other relevant lines. Signatories commit themselves to revising governance structures as necessary to create such an environment, including but not limited to transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.\"\nOther specific proposals echo those that were present in a\nset of demands\nmade to Harvard: assess viewpoint diversity on campus and take steps to ensure it is present \"not just in the university as a whole, but within every field, department, school, and teaching unit.\" Universities must also prevent anyone protesting on campus, including non-students, from disrupting classes or study, or heckling other students.\nOne area where viewpoint diversity isn't welcome, however, is sex and gender. \"Institutions commit to defining and otherwise interpreting 'male,' 'female,' 'woman,' and 'man' according to reproductive function and biological processes.\" First Amendment rights are also targeted, as anyone representing the university \"will abstain from actions or speech relating to societal and political events except in cases in which external events have a direct impact upon the university.\"\nThe Compact also intends to micromanage grades to ensure they \"only rigorously reflect the demonstrated mastery of a subject.\" Again, schools would be expected to post anonymized grade distributions so that grade inflation or deflation could be detected. Note that it's technically possible for entire classes to demonstrate mastery of a topic, which would, based on this standard, result in badly skewed grade distributions; there's no reason to expect that every class will produce a neat bell curve of grades. The fact that the people preparing this document don't seem aware of this provides an indication that these demands were not carefully thought through.\nAlso in the realm of poorly considered ideas: Any university that has an endowment that's worth more than $2 million per student will be required to give students free tuition if they're majoring in the hard sciences. Not only will that incentivize students to start in those fields and switch majors as late as possible, but it comes at a time when the administration's attacks on science and education are putting the job prospects of science majors at serious risk. Yet, at the same time, the Compact also demands that schools inform students of the earning potential of different majors.\nNot real reform\nThere's a lot more there: demands for a five-year tuition freeze, compliance with money laundering rules for donations, hiring third parties to ensure compliance, etc. Each university will have to set up an entirely new bureaucracy to ensure that it can follow all these additional rules—in part because failure to do so will get them referred to the Department of Justice. At the same time, however, the Compact wants university administration to be reduced.\nThe number of demands that undercut the goals that are supposedly motivating other demands in this document make it very clear that it's not a serious attempt at educational reform. Instead, it can be best understood as part of the administration's larger campaign to cripple US universities and the science that goes on there.\nAs far back as 2021, now-Vice President JD Vance\nwas saying,\n“We have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” And the administration has been very blatant about pursuing that attack, using federal funding to try to force universities to make changes that have little to nothing to do with the reasons the funding was given in the first place. The Compact fits in directly with the larger campaign by giving universities a stark choice: give up control over basic university functions to this administration, or face sanctions that will essentially eliminate the ability to function as a research university.\nFor that research, it also represents an abandonment of the idea that the key determinant in funding should be scientific merit, a principle that has guided the US research endeavor for decades. Now, compliance with administration demands can overrule scientific merit in all circumstances, a situation that reinforces\nan executive order\nthat placed the results of peer review by scientists behind political considerations evaluated by bureaucrats.\nThere is no way that these changes will do anything other than cripple the US research effort, with downstream impacts both domestically and globally.\nJohn Timmer\nSenior Science Editor\nJohn Timmer\nSenior Science Editor\nJohn is Ars Technica's science editor.

She has written previously for\nWirecutter\n,\nWired\n,\nDwell\n,\nBBC\n, and\nUS News\n.\nThis week, Ring, an Amazon-owned smart security company, announced\nSearch Party\n, a new feature to help find lost dogs. When someone posts a picture of a lost dog on\nRing’s Neighbors app\n, they will be able to initiate a Search Party. Ring then uses AI to scan footage from nearby outdoor Ring cameras and doorbells for the lost pet. If it’s detected via someone else’s device, that camera’s owner will receive a notification and can choose to share the video with the pet owner.\nI should be able to choose whether my footage is being searched\nIt’s a great use of AI and has the potential to track down missing pets a lot faster than social media posts or text message chains. This is because it (almost) cuts out the middleman — you. Rather than relying on you to see a message about a missing dog, look at a picture or read through the description of the dog, and then go check your camera feeds to see if it ran by your house, all of that happens in the background.\n“Your Ring AI assistant is looking for that dog and is going to tell you, ‘Look, this dog I saw looks like this dog that’s missing,’” Ring’s founder, Jamie Siminoff, told me in an interview at Amazon’s event this week. You can then decide whether to share the video or just notify the owner through the Neighbors app, he explained.\nRelated\nRing launches upgraded cameras with Retinal Vision 4K recording\nAmazon’s September 2025 hardware event: all the news and announcements\nHowever, it turns out that Search Party is enabled\nby default\n. In\nan email to customers\nthis week, Siminoff wrote that the feature is rolling out to Ring outdoor cameras in November and noted, “You can always turn off Search Party.”\nI checked my cameras this morning, and they were all automatically set to enable Search Party. And I’m not alone; Ring users on Reddit have also reported that\ntheir cameras have been enabled for Search Party\n. As Siminoff wrote, I can turn this off, and if I don’t, I will get to review any footage it finds before deciding what to do with it. Ring says no video is shared without the owner’s consent.\nPrevious\nNext\n1\n/\n2\nSearch Party was enabled by default in my Ring app.\nHowever, getting opted in by default feels intrusive, particularly for a company with a\ncheckered history\naround sharing footage with the police. While mass adoption enabled by a default opt-in will undoubtedly make the feature much more effective — and yes, I want to help find my neighbors’ dogs — I should be able to choose whether my footage is being searched.\nI do get a choice in whether or not to share that alert with the dog’s owner\nThis is more about consent than privacy. Essentially, Search Party is working in the same way as Ring’s current AI-powered smart alerts for people, vehicles, and packages. The footage from your camera is analyzed in Ring’s cloud for those things. That’s what happens when you get a Ring alert that a package has been delivered. Only now, when someone else initiates a Search Party in the Neighbors app, Ring can also look for a specific dog on others’ cameras. The difference is that I told Ring I wanted it to search for packages, I didn’t tell it to look for dogs.\nAgain, when it comes to the dog, I do get a choice in whether or not to share that alert with the dog’s owner. It won’t be sent to them automatically. “We don’t want data escaping people’s environment without them knowing,” Siminoff told me.\nImage: Ring\nWhile most people will happily help someone find their lost dog, there is a concern about where this could lead. This week, the company also announced it’s bringing facial recognition to its cameras for the first time.\nFamiliar Faces\nlets you register images of family and friends in the app so you can get specific alerts about who your cameras see.\nThe combination of Search Party and facial recognition raises the question of whether the Ring cloud could one day be used to search for specific individuals. Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger told me that there are no plans around this for now. “Search Party was designed to match images of dogs to dogs captured in Ring videos,” she said. “It is not designed to process human biometrics.”\nAdditionally, she said Search Party footage is not included in\nRing’s Community Requests service,\nwhich allows police and other public safety agencies to request help from the public.\nAs someone who regularly uses her own cameras to locate her pets, I think Search Party could be a great tool, and I will keep it enabled on the Ring cameras at my home. But I still think Ring should have asked before turning it on for everyone.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nClose\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nSenior Reviewer, Smart Home\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nAmazon\nClose\nAmazon\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAmazon\nNews\nClose\nNews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nNews\nSmart Home\nClose\nSmart Home\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSmart Home\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMore in this stream\nSee all\nGoogle’s new Nest cams are designed for Gemini\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nOct 1\nGoogle’s Home Speaker looks and sounds better — but you can’t get it yet\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nOct 1\nWalmart’s Onn cameras were developed with Google and start at just $23\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nOct 1\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nSatya Nadella appoints a new CEO to run Microsoft’s biggest businesses\nBehold: The Lego Game Boy has already been modded to play games for real\nHey Google, meet Gemini: the new voice of your smart home\nMicrosoft revamps Xbox Game Pass plans and hikes Ultimate to $29.99 a month\nMicrosoft’s new Office icons are more curvy and colorful\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

    "source": "OpenAI is gearing up to host its third-ever annual developer conference, DevDay 2025, on Monday. The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI’s “biggest event yet,” which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.\nFrom the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI’s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently\nbuilding an AI device\n, a\nsocial media app\n, and\nan AI-powered browser\nto take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models.\nAt the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.\nIn the last year, Anthropic and Google’s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.\nOpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model,\nGPT-4 Turbo\n, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called\nthe GPT Store\n. Altman was\nousted as CEO\ndays later — only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an\nAPI for AI voice applications\n, but not much else.\nNothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it’s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it’s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It’s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, which OpenAI has barely discussed since it launched several years ago.\nTechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news.

One of them is “Sora Cinema,” which is described as a “cozy mini-theater with popcorn” featuring short films generated by OpenAI’s video model, Sora. There’s also supposed to be a phone booth with a “living portrait” of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing “that speaks back.”\nLater in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay.

    "source": "Featured\nGoogle's Jules coding agent moves beyond chat with new command line and API\nEmilia David\nOctober 2, 2025\nGoogle\nwants its coding assistant, Jules, to be far more integrated into developers’ terminals than ever. The company wants to make it a more workflow-native tool, hoping that more people will use it beyond the chat interface.\nJules, which the company first announced\nin December 2024\n, will gain two new features: a Jules API to facilitate integration with IDEs and a Jules Tools CLI, allowing the agent to be opened directly on the command line.\nMore companies find that bringing their agents, coding-focused or not, into the applications people removes a lot of friction for enterprise users. Jules takes this trend a step further by adopting the same workflow as developers.\n“Until today, you’ve primarily interacted with Jules in your web browser, but we know developers live in the terminal,” said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in\na blog post\n. “It’s where we test, build, debug, and ship. That’s why we built Jules Tools, a lightweight command line interface, so you can spin up tasks, inspect what Jules is doing, and make the agent your own, all without leaving your workflow.”\nThrough Jules CLI and API, Google said enterprises will get “more control and flexibility by where and how you can use Jules.”\nIn May, Google\nreleased Jules into beta\nand announced GitHub integration. It became\ngenerally available\nin August with higher rate limits for Google AI Pro and Ultra users.\nMoving away from chat\nAs Korevec said, the primary way developers and enterprises interact with agents is through a chat interface.\nOther coding agents have begun integrating their coding tools into IDEs and CLIs.\nOpenAI\nrolled out a fine-tuned version\nof GPT-5, called GPT-5-Codex, that will initiate the process of unifying its Codex coding assistant with IDEs, CLIs, and other workflows. Google also\nreleased Gemini CLI\n, which acts similarly to Jules Tools CLI, but is open-sourced and can be brought to other platforms.\nCoding agents are already becoming essential tools for enterprises, and as their\npreferences solidify\n, providers like Google, OpenAI and\nAnthropic\nwant these agents to be more top of mind for users.\nEnterprises envision AI agents to be\nmore passive, ambient tools,\nwhich can be difficult to imagine if most people interact with them via chat and have to prompt them to work. If adoption is high, that more proactive and integrated future will be clearer.\nHow Tools and API work\nDevelopers can install Jules Tools via npm, which will then print a guide on how to use it. While in the CLI, an engineer or coder can use the code Command to prompt Jules to do a task, and the code Flag will customize it. For example, this string, jules --theme light, will switch to light mode.\nOn the API side, enterprises can connect the Jules API to other platforms they use. They can connect it to Slack, for example, so that some team members can trigger tasks directly from Slack if a bug is reported there, which will then tap their CI/CD pipeline.\nGoogle also added other updates to help reduce latency and fix some environment and file system issues. These include:\nFile selector to call out specific files in chat to add context\nMemory, which gives Jules the ability to remember preferences going forward\nEnvironment Variables management that gives Jules access to these variables while executing a task\nResponse so far\nSince its announcement, the response has been mostly positive. However, some are confused over Google’s two coding agent CLI offerings.\nSubscribe to get latest news!\nDeep insights for enterprise AI, data, and security leaders\nVB Daily\nAI Weekly\nAGI Weekly\nSecurity Weekly\nData Infrastructure Weekly\nVB Events\nAll of them\nGet updates\nYou're in!

Threat-screening tools may miss AI-designed proteins.\nOrdering DNA for AI-designed toxins doesn't always raise red flags.\nJohn Timmer\n–\nOct 3, 2025 4:12 pm\n|\n2\nDesigning variations of the complex, three-dimensional structures of proteins has been made a lot easier by AI tools.\nCredit:\nHistorical / Contributor\nDesigning variations of the complex, three-dimensional structures of proteins has been made a lot easier by AI tools.\nCredit:\nHistorical / Contributor\nText\n        settings\nStory text\nSize\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\n*\nStandard\nWide\nLinks\nStandard\nOrange\n* Subscribers only\nLearn more\nMinimize to nav\nOn Thursday, a team of researchers led by Microsoft announced that they had discovered, and possibly patched, what they're terming a biological zero-day—an unrecognized security hole in a system that protects us from biological threats. The system at risk screens purchases of DNA sequences to determine when someone's ordering DNA that encodes a toxin or dangerous virus. But, the researchers argue, it has become increasingly vulnerable to missing a new threat: AI-designed toxins.\nHow big of a threat is this? To understand, you have to know a bit more about both existing biosurveillance programs and the capabilities of AI-designed proteins.\nCatching the bad ones\nBiological threats come in a variety of forms. Some are pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Others are protein-based toxins, like the ricin that was\nsent to the White House\nin 2003. Still others are chemical toxins that are produced through enzymatic reactions, like the molecules\nassociated with red tide\n. All of them get their start through the same fundamental biological process: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then used to make proteins.\nFor several decades now, starting the process has been as easy as ordering the needed DNA sequence online from any of a number of companies, which will synthesize a requested sequence and ship it out. Recognizing the potential threat here, governments and industry have worked together to add a screening step to every order: the DNA sequence is scanned for its ability to encode parts of proteins or viruses considered threats. Any positives are then flagged for human intervention to evaluate whether they or the people ordering them truly represent a danger.\nBoth the list of proteins and the sophistication of the scanning have been continually updated in response to research progress over the years. For example, initial screening was done based on similarity to target DNA sequences. But there are many DNA sequences that can encode the same protein, so the screening algorithms have been adjusted accordingly, recognizing all the DNA variants that pose an identical threat.\nThe new work can be thought of as an extension of that threat. Not only can multiple DNA sequences encode the same protein; multiple proteins can perform the same function. To form a toxin, for example, typically requires the protein to adopt the correct three-dimensional structure, which brings a handful of critical amino acids within the protein into close proximity. Outside of those critical amino acids, however, things can often be quite flexible. Some amino acids may not matter at all; other locations in the protein could work with any positively charged amino acid, or any hydrophobic one.\nIn the past, it could be extremely difficult (meaning time-consuming and expensive) to do the experiments that would tell you what sorts of changes a string of amino acids could tolerate while remaining functional. But the team behind the new analysis recognized that AI protein design tools have now gotten quite sophisticated and can predict when distantly related sequences can fold up into the same shape and catalyze the same reactions. The process is still error-prone, and you often have to test a dozen or more proposed proteins to get a working one, but it has\nproduced some impressive successes\n.\nSo, the team developed a hypothesis to test: AI can take an existing toxin and design a protein with the same function that's distantly related enough that the screening programs do not detect orders for the DNA that encodes it.\nThe zero-day treatment\nThe team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.\n\"Taking inspiration from established cybersecurity processes for addressing such situations, we contacted the relevant bodies regarding the potential vulnerability, including the International Gene Synthesis Consortium and trusted colleagues in the protein design community as well as leads in biosecurity at the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, US National Institute of Standards and Technologies, US Department of Homeland Security, and US Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response,\" the authors report. \"Outside of those bodies, details were kept confidential until a more comprehensive study could be performed in pursuit of potential mitigations and for 'patches'... to be developed and deployed.\"\nDetails of that original test are\nbeing made available today\nas part of a much larger analysis that extends the approach to a large range of toxic proteins. Starting with 72 toxins, the researchers used three open source AI packages to generate a total of about 75,000 potential protein variants.\nAnd this is where things get a little complicated. Many of the AI-designed protein variants are going to end up being non-functional, either subtly or catastrophically failing to fold up into the correct configuration to create an active toxin. The only way to know which ones work is to make the proteins and test them biologically; most AI protein design efforts will make actual proteins from dozens to hundreds of the most promising-looking potential designs to find a handful that are active. But doing that for 75,000 designs is completely unrealistic.\nInstead, the researchers used two software-based tools to evaluate each of the 75,000 designs. One of these focuses on the similarity between the overall predicted physical structure of the proteins, and another looks at the predicted differences between the positions of individual amino acids. Either way, they're a rough approximation of just how similar the proteins formed by two strings of amino acids should be. But they're definitely not a clear indicator of whether those two proteins would be equally functional.\nIn any case, DNA sequences encoding all 75,000 designs were fed into the software that screens DNA orders for potential threats. One thing that was very clear is that there were huge variations in the ability of the four screening programs to flag these variant designs as threatening. Two of them seemed to do a pretty good job, one was mixed, and another let most of them through. Three of the software packages were updated in response to this performance, which significantly improved their ability to pick out variants.\nThere was also a clear trend in all four screening packages: The closer the variant was to the original structurally, the more likely the package (both before and after the patches) was to be able to flag it as a threat. In all cases, there was also a cluster of variant designs that were unlikely to fold into a similar structure, and these generally weren't flagged as threats.\nWhat does this mean?\nAgain, it's important to emphasize that this evaluation is based on predicted structures; \"unlikely\" to fold into a similar structure to the original toxin doesn't mean these proteins will be inactive as toxins. Functional proteins are probably going to be very rare among this group, but there may be a handful in there. That handful is also probably rare enough that you would have to order up and test far too many designs to find one that works, making this an impractical threat vector.\nAt the same time, there are also a handful of proteins that are very similar to the toxin structurally and not flagged by the software. For the three patched versions of the software, the ones that slip through the screening represent about 1 to 3 percent of the total in the \"very similar\" category. That's not great, but it's probably good enough that any group that tries to order up a toxin by this method would attract attention because they'd have to order over 50 just to have a good chance of finding one that slipped through, which would raise all sorts of red flags.\nOne other notable result is that the designs that weren't flagged were mostly variants of just a handful of toxin proteins. So this is less of a general problem with the screening software and might be more of a small set of focused problems. Of note, one of the proteins that produced a lot of unflagged variants isn't toxic itself; instead, it's a co-factor necessary for the actual toxin to do its thing. As such, some of the screening software packages didn't even flag the original protein as dangerous, much less any of its variants. (For these reasons, the company that makes one of the better-performing software packages decided the threat here wasn't significant enough to merit a security patch.)\nSo, on its own, this work doesn't seem to have identified something that's a major threat at the moment. But it's probably useful, in that it's a good thing to get the people who engineer the screening software to start thinking about emerging threats.\nThat's because, as the people behind this work note, AI protein design is still in its early stages, and we're likely to see considerable improvements. And there's likely to be a limit to the sorts of things we can screen for. We're already at the point where AI protein design tools can be used to create proteins that have entirely novel functions and do so without starting with variants of existing proteins. In other words, we can design proteins that are impossible to screen for based on similarity to known threats, because they don't look at all like anything we know is dangerous.\nProtein-based toxins would be very difficult to design, because they have to both cross the cell membrane and then do something dangerous once inside. While AI tools are probably unable to design something that sophisticated at the moment, I would be hesitant to rule out the prospects of them eventually reaching that sort of sophistication.\nScience, 2025.

It consisted of just a plain white background with “https://” and a single line of grouped numbers hanging over Nob Hill, San Francisco.\nLast month, Alfred Wahlforss, the startup’s CEO,\nposted on X\nthat whoever cracked the code and completed a subsequent challenge would win a trip to Berlin and get on the guest list for the ultra-exclusive nightclub Berghain.\nOne of the more elaborate tech startup recruiting stunts in recent memory worked, Wahlforss later told me. Within days, the billboard garnered millions of views online, attracted\nmedia coverage\n, collected 10,000 email sign-ups, and led to roughly 60 interviews with potential candidates.\nIn recent conversations I’ve had with Wahlforss and other startup founders, it’s clear that, even for well-funded firms, attracting top technical talent is more challenging than ever. “We are spending a ton of money to not even advertise the company, but just to advertise us to engineers,” according to Wahlforss, whose company has raised $27 million from Sequoia. “It has been extremely challenging to hire good people. I have a friend who’s a high school dropout, and he can work at OpenAI and make like $2 million a year.”\n“You spend hours with people who end up rejecting you and just go to Anthropic. It’s very, very painful.”\nWahlforss told me about a recent candidate who loved cycling. His cofounder showed up at the candidate’s house with a high-end carbon road bike. The gesture helped push the candidate to turn down other offers. More often, though, he said it’s impossible to compete with the biggest names in AI and Big Tech. “You spend hours with people who end up rejecting you and just go to Anthropic. It’s very, very painful.”\nYou don’t have to look far to hear similar stories of rejection. Austin Hughes, the CEO of Unify, an AI sales platform that has raised over $50 million, commissioned a painting for a coveted candidate. But OpenAI offered triple the compensation that Unify could provide. The candidate took the money and kept the painting.\nJesse Zhang, the CEO of Decagon, is feeling the same squeeze despite running a fast-growing startup currently valued at $1.5 billion. “It’s one of the things I’m thinking about day to day,” he told me when I asked about the difficulty of recruiting. Decagon has pulled the classic levers to attract candidates, such as hosting fancy dinners with its investor, Accel, and offering courtside tickets to Warriors games. Zhang said he even drove to the South Bay recently and met with a candidate’s family.\nHowever, the most reliable tactic he mentioned was not flashy at all: “All the senior hires we’ve made in the first 100 people were all just people I knew.” Hughes said his team at Unify exports their LinkedIn networks into a shared Google Sheet and creates an index match to find the best candidates with the most employee connections.\nSo who are all these companies chasing? Across my conversations, a consistent archetype emerged: an “AI product engineer” who can wield the latest AI tools at blistering speed without “shipping slop” and can also do the job of a product manager. “The intersection of being highly technical and also being product-centric is very small,” according to Wahlforss. He estimates the pool to consist of a couple of thousand people at most, each with “ten offers” at any given moment.\nWhile OpenAI and Anthropic are still seen as two of the most desirable places to work for these kinds of people, a refrain I heard repeatedly from founders is that the big AI labs are quickly becoming indistinguishable from the rest of Big Tech. As Wahlforss framed it, the edge for a startup is telling a recruit they can be “almost like a mini founder” and “build products end-to-end.”\nTop-tier investors and recognizable brands help at the margins, but another consensus was that a fancy cap table matters less now because so many startups are well-funded. Zhang thinks the hiring frenzy won’t last forever, though. There’s “too much capital,” too many AI startups, and at some point, the bubble will burst, he said. The trouble is nobody knows when.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nAlex Heath\nClose\nAlex Heath\nSources author, Verge contributor\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nAlex Heath\nAI\nClose\nAI\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAI\nColumn\nClose\nColumn\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nColumn\nSources\nClose\nSources\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSources\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nApple pulls ICEBlock from the App Store\nBehold: The Lego Game Boy has already been modded to play games for real\nEverything is terrorism in Trump’s America\nSatya Nadella appoints a new CEO to run Microsoft’s biggest businesses\nMicrosoft is about to launch free Xbox Cloud Gaming with ads\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad"

    "source": "Apps\nGoogle is also removing apps used to report sightings of ICE agents\nRed Dot, an app used to anonymously report ICE activity, was recently pulled from both the Play Store and the App Store.\nIan Carlos Campbell\nContributing Reporter\nIan Carlos Campbell\nContributing Reporter\nFri, October 3, 2025 at 7:29 PM UTC\n2 min read\nAdd Engadget on Google\nRed Dot / Engadget\nFollowing\nApple's removal of ICEBlock\nfrom the App Store, an app used to report on the activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents,\n404 Media\nreports\nthat Google is also removing similar apps from the Play Store. In a statement to Engadget, Google said \"ICEBlock was never available on Google Play, but we removed similar apps for violations of our policies.\"\nGoogle says that it decided to remove apps that shared the location of a vulnerable group following a violent act that involved the group and a similar collection of apps. It suggests the apps were also removed because they didn't appropriately moderate user-generated content. To be offered in the Play Store, apps with user-generated content have to clearly define what is or isn't objectionable content in their terms of service, and make sure those terms line up with Google's definitions of\ninappropriate content\nfor Google Play.\n404 Media\nreport specifically focuses on Red Dot, an app that both Google and Apple removed. Like ICEBlock, Red Dot designed to let users report on ICE activity in their neighborhood. Rather than just rely on user submissions,\nthe app's website\nsays that it \"aggregates verified reports from multiple trusted sources\" and then combines those sources to determine where to mark activity on a map of your area. \"Red Dot never tracks ICE agents, law enforcement, or any person's movements\" and the app's developers \"categorically reject harassment, interference, or harm toward ICE agents or anyone else.\" Despite those claims, the app is not currently available to download from the Play Store or the App Store.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe pushback against ICE tracking apps seemed to begin in earnest following a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility that injured two detainees and killed another on September 24. According to an FBI agent that\nspoke to\nThe New York Times\n, the shooter \"had been following apps that track the location of ICE agents\" in the days leading up to the event.\nApple pulled the ICEBlock app from the App Store yesterday following a request from US Attorney General Pam Bondi. In a statement shared with\nFox Business\n, Bondi said that \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed.\" Apple's response was to remove the app. \"Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store,\" Apple told the publication.\nGoogle says it didn't receive a similar request to remove apps from the Play Store. Instead, the company appears to be acting proactively. The test for either platform going forward, though, is if there's a way that developers can offer these apps without them being removed again.\nAbout our ads"

    "topic": "Huawei's new open source technique shrinks LLMs to make them run on less powerful, less expensive hardware",
    "source": "Huawei's new open source technique shrinks LLMs to make them run on less powerful, less expensive hardware\nCarl Franzen\nOctober 3, 2025\nHuawei’s Computing Systems Lab in Zurich has introduced a\nnew open-source quantization method\nfor large language models (LLMs) aimed at reducing memory demands without sacrificing output quality.\nThe technique, called\nSINQ (Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization)\n, is designed to be fast, calibration-free, and easy to integrate into existing model workflows. The code for performing it has been made available by the Huawei research team on\nGithub\nand\nHugging Face\nunder a permissive, enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license, allowing organizations to take and use it, modify it, and deploy it commercially — all for free.\nAcross models of different sizes, SINQ cuts memory usage by\n60–70%\n, depending on architecture and bit-width.\nThis enables models that would previously require >60 GB of memory to run on\n~20 GB setups\n—a critical enabler for running large models on a single high-end GPU or even multi-GPU consumer-grade setups.\nThis makes it possible to run models that previously needed high-end enterprise GPUs—like NVIDIA’s A100 or H100—on significantly more affordable hardware, such as a single\nNvidia GeForce\nRTX 4090\n(\naround $1600\n), instead of enterprise hardware like the\nA100 80GB\n(\n$19,000\n) or even\nH100\nunits that\nexceed $30,000\n.\nFor teams using cloud infrastructure, the savings are similarly tangible. A100-based instances often cost $3–4.50 per hour, while 24 GB GPUs like the RTX 4090 are available on many platforms for $1–1.50 per hour.\nOver time, especially for extended inference workloads, this difference can add up to\nthousands of dollars in cost reductions\n, while also unlocking LLM deployment on smaller clusters, local workstations, or consumer-grade setups previously constrained by memory.\nTackling the Memory Challenge of LLMs\nRunning large models often requires compromises between performance and size.\nIn practice, neural networks use\nfloating-point numbers\nto represent both weights and activations. A floating-point number can express a wide range of values (very small, very large, with fractional parts).\nThis flexibility is helpful because during training and inference, weights and activations can vary in scale dramatically. Using floating-point lets the model adjust precisely. (For example, a weight could be 0.0023 or 123.45, and floating-point can capture both with decent precision.)\nQuantization — a method that reduces the precision of model weights — offers a practical path to lower memory usage, but typically comes with trade-offs in model quality, especially at 4-bit precision and below.\nWhen you convert those floating-point values into lower-precision formats (like 8-bit integers), you’re approximating them.\nThat means you store and compute with fewer bits, which is faster and more memory-efficient — but you risk losing fidelity (i.e. introducing small errors).\nThe trick is to do the conversion carefully so the model’s behavior stays nearly the same, even though internally it’s working with rougher approximations of those weights and activations.\nSINQ addresses these pain points by introducing a plug-and-play solution that delivers strong performance even in low-precision settings—without requiring calibration data or inter-layer dependencies.\nHow SINQ Works\nThe SINQ approach introduces two main innovations:\nDual-Axis Scaling:\nInstead of using a single scale factor for quantizing a matrix, SINQ uses separate scaling vectors for rows and columns. This helps mitigate the effects of outliers and allows the quantization error to be distributed more flexibly across the matrix.\nSinkhorn-Knopp-Style Normalization:\nA fast algorithm inspired by Sinkhorn iterations is used to normalize the standard deviations of rows and columns in a matrix. This helps minimize what the authors call “matrix imbalance,” a new proxy metric shown to be more effective than alternatives like kurtosis for improving quantization performance.\nThe combination of these two features allows SINQ to outperform other calibration-free techniques such as Round-To-Nearest (RTN), HQQ, and Hadamard-based quantization across multiple benchmarks.\nPerformance and Compatibility\nSINQ has been evaluated across a wide range of architectures and models, including the Qwen3 series, LLaMA, and DeepSeek.\nOn benchmarks like WikiText2 and C4, SINQ consistently reduces perplexity and flip rates compared to baseline methods, often approaching or matching the performance of calibrated solutions.\nIt also supports non-uniform quantization schemes such as NF4 and can be combined with calibration methods like AWQ, leading to the variant A-SINQ. In calibrated settings, A-SINQ further narrows the gap with full-precision models.\nIn terms of runtime efficiency, SINQ quantizes models roughly twice as fast as HQQ and over 30 times faster than AWQ.

    "summary": "Huawei's new open source technique shrinks LLMs to make them run on less powerful, less expensive hardware\nCarl Franzen\nOctober 3, 2025\nHuawei’s Computing Systems Lab in Zurich has introduced a\nnew open-source quantization method\nfor large language models (LLMs) aimed at reducing memory demands without sacrificing output quality.\nThe technique, called\nSINQ (Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization)\n, is designed to be fast, calibration-free, and easy to integrate into existing model workflows. The code for performing it has been made available by the Huawei research team on\nGithub\nand\nHugging Face\nunder a permissive, enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license, allowing organizations to take and use it, modify it, and deploy it commercially — all for free.\nAcross models of different sizes, SINQ cuts memory usage by\n60–70%\n, depending on architecture and bit-width.\nThis enables models that would previously require >60 GB of memory to run on\n~20 GB setups\n—a critical enabler for running large models on a single high-end GPU or even multi-GPU consumer-grade setups.\nThis makes it possible to run models that previously needed high-end enterprise GPUs—like NVIDIA’s A100 or H100—on significantly more affordable hardware, such as a single\nNvidia GeForce\nRTX 4090\n(\naround $1600\n), instead of enterprise hardware like the\nA100 80GB\n(\n$19,000\n) or even\nH100\nunits that\nexceed $30,000\n.\nFor teams using cloud infrastructure, the savings are similarly tangible. A100-based instances often cost $3–4.50 per hour, while 24 GB GPUs like the RTX 4090 are available on many platforms for $1–1.50 per hour.\nOver time, especially for extended inference workloads, this difference can add up to\nthousands of dollars in cost reductions\n, while also unlocking LLM deployment on smaller clusters, local workstations, or consumer-grade setups previously constrained by memory.\nTackling the Memory Challenge of LLMs\nRunning large models often requires compromises between performance and size.",

The military announced this year's launch orders Friday, and SpaceX was the big winner.\nSpace Systems Command, the unit responsible for awarding military launch contracts, selected SpaceX to launch five of the seven missions up for assignment this year. United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, won contracts for the other two. These missions for the Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office are still at least a couple of years away from flying.\nSpaceX and ULA are the only companies with rockets certified by the Space Force to launch the Pentagon's big-ticket satellites. ULA's Vulcan rocket, which replaces the company's Atlas V, debuted nearly two years ago and successfully launched its\nfirst national security mission in August\n. SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets each have long track records of success.\nThe New Glenn rocket from Jeff Bezos's space company Blue Origin is also part of the Space Force's roster of rockets, but must complete at least\none more successful flight\nbefore receiving military certification for the Pentagon's exclusive National Security Space Launch (NSSL) missions.\n\"Space is the ultimate high ground, critical for our national security. With this year's NSSL Phase 3 Lane 2 mission assignments, we continue to assure access to that high ground,\" said Col. Eric Zarybnisky, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space.\nThe military's selection of SpaceX for the bulk of this year's mission assignments was no surprise. The Space Force\nannounced in April that SpaceX will receive the majority\nof Space Force launch contracts over the next several years, with ULA getting second-most, and Blue Origin eligible as a third launch provider. Space Force officials said at the time they reserve the right to reapportion missions between the three providers if one of them runs into trouble.\nHowever, a closer examination of this year's National Security Space Launch contracts reveals some interesting things.\nPaying a premium\nThe Space Force is paying SpaceX $714 million for the five launches awarded Friday, for an average of roughly $143 million per mission. ULA will receive $428 million for two missions, or $214 million for each launch. That's about 50 percent more expensive than SpaceX's price per mission.\nWhile notable, these prices are close to the numbers from the\nlast batch of contracts\n, when SpaceX charged $121 million per mission, and ULA's price was $214 million per launch, the same as this year. Part of this price difference could be explained by SpaceX's reuse of Falcon boosters, whereas ULA's Vulcan rocket is a disposable design.\nBut look back a little further and you'll find ULA's prices for Space Force launches have, for some reason, increased significantly over the last few years. In late 2023, the\nSpace Force awarded a $1.3 billion deal\nto ULA for a batch of 11 launches at an average cost per mission of $119 million. A few months earlier, Space Systems Command assigned six launches to ULA for $672 million, or $112 million per mission.\nThe average value of SpaceX's military launch contracts remained fairly steady over the same timeframe.\nULA and SpaceX competed for military launch orders from 2020 through 2024 as part of the Space Force's NSSL Phase 2 contract. The Space Force added more money to each company's Phase 2 contract—$1.1 billion for ULA and $661 million for SpaceX—in mid-2024 to help cover a higher number of launches than the military originally expected.\nAccounting for this funding surge, ULA's total haul of 26 Phase 2 launches came in at an average of $173 million per mission, still significantly less than ULA's prices this year. SpaceX's average launch price was $182 million, far more than the company's prices in 2025. Part of SpaceX's Phase 2 contract money went toward\nupgrades of ground infrastructure\nand development of an extended payload fairing for the Falcon Heavy rocket.\nA SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket with NASA's Psyche spacecraft launches from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on October 13, 2023.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\nThe launch orders announced Friday comprise the second batch of NSSL Phase 3 missions the Space Force has awarded to SpaceX and ULA.\nIt's important to remember that these prices aren't what ULA or SpaceX would charge a commercial satellite customer. The US government pays a premium for access to space. The Space Force, the National Reconnaissance Office, and NASA don't insure their launches like a commercial customer would do. Instead, government agencies have more insight into their launch contractors, including inspections, flight data reviews, risk assessments, and security checks. Government missions also typically get priority on ULA and SpaceX's launch schedules. All of this adds up to more money.\nA heavy burden\nFour of the five launches awarded to SpaceX Friday will use the company's larger Falcon Heavy rocket, according to Lt. Col. Kristina Stewart at Space Systems Command. One will fly on SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9. This is the first time a majority of the Space Force's annual launch orders has required the lift capability of a Falcon Heavy, with three Falcon 9 booster cores combining to heave larger payloads into space.\nAll versions of ULA's Vulcan rocket use a single core booster, with varying numbers of strap-on solid-fueled rocket motors to provide extra thrust off the launch pad.\nHere's a breakdown of the seven new missions assigned to SpaceX and ULA:\n•\nUSSF-149:\nClassified payload on a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Florida\n•\nUSSF-63:\nClassified payload on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy from Florida\n•\nUSSF-155:\nClassified payload SpaceX Falcon Heavy from Florida\n•\nUSSF-205:\nWGS-12 communications satellite on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy from Florida\n•\nNROL-86:\nClassified payload on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy from Florida\n•\nUSSF-88:\nGPS IIIF-4 navigation satellite on a ULA Vulcan VC2S (two solid rocket boosters) from Florida\n•\nNROL-88:\nClassified payload on a ULA Vulcan VC4S (four solid rocket boosters) from Florida\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

It's a slim machine that can fit into tight spaces, and fit flush against a wall, but which packs enough power to use in extra-large spaces.\nInside, you'll find a 3-stage filtration system that includes a washable pre-filter, and a H13 True HEPA filter and an activated charcoal filter combo. I have an open plan home with no walls separating the living room and kitchen, and the EverestAir did an excellent job of purifying the space quickly and effectively, including clearing my neighbor's cigarette smoke. In fact, this is one of the most effective air purifiers I've ever reviewed – and I've tested over 50 of the\nbest air purifiers\non the market.\nThe mode I used most often was Auto, where a laser dust sensor scans for airborne particles and increases or decreases the fan speed as necessary. There's also a Sleep mode and a Turbo mode.\nThe control panel includes plenty of options, but they're clearly presented and the information is easy to navigate and digest. The air quality score, along with color-coded rings, provide you with an at-a-glance overview. At the touch of a button, you can also cycle through readings for specific particulate matter, such as PM 1.0 (fine dust and microtoxins), PM 2.5 (dust, smoke, and pet dander) and PM 10 (pollen, ash, and airborne allergens). There's no remote control, but you can control the EverestAir from a distance using the companion app, which includes options to turn the device on or off, switch modes, create a schedule and more.\nNormally, the airflow on an air purifier is in a fixed position. However, the Levoit EverestAir has adjustable vent angles, which is ideal for directing the clean air to suit the position of the purifier. Cleverly, when the air purifier is not in use, the vents close completely to keep dust out.\nThat's the short version – read on for my full Levoit EverestAir review.\n(Image credit: Future)\nLevoit EverestAir Smart Air Purifier (White) at Amazon for $349.99\nLevoit EverestAir review: price & availability\nList price: $499\nAvailable: US\nThe Levoit EverestAir has a list price of\n$499.99\nand is available to purchase direct from Levoit US via\nAmazon\n.

However, it only needs to be replaced every 12-15 months with normal use… so you could think of it like a $50 filter that needs to be replaced every 6 months, if that helps.\nIn the air purifier market, the Levoit EverestAir is considered a mid-range purchase. It's more expensive than the\nLevoit Core 300S\n, which is TechRadar's top budget air purifier choice. On the other hand, it's significantly less pricey than the likes of the\nDyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde BP04\n. For me, the features, functions, and build quality certainly justify the price, and it delivers strong value for the money.\nValue for money score: 4.5 out of 5\nLevoit EverestAir specs\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\nCADR:\n354 CFM / 601 m³/h\nSize:\n18.9 x 8.5 x 23.2in / 48 x 21.6 x 58.9cm\nControl:\nButtons, app, voice\nFilters:\nPre-filter, H13 HEPA, activated carbon\nModes:\nLow, medium, high, Auto, Sleep, Turbo\nContaminants detected:\nPM1, PM2.5, PM10\nModel code:\nLAP-EL551S-AUS\nLevoit EverestAir review: design\nSleek, compact design with easy filter access and wheels for moving\nVents can be angled to suit the position of the purifier\nCan be controlled via touchscreen buttons, a companion app, or voice\nAir purifiers can be bulky, but the Levoit EverestAir Air Purifier has a sleek design that's less than 9 inches / 22.9cm wide. When I'm working at my desk, it's usually positioned in the tight space between my desk and sofa.\nThe EverestAir has a white front, stainless steel back, and black top, and the design is unique enough that visitors to my home often point to the machine and ask what it is. (For context, I also have a TruSens air purifier that looks like a speaker, and a Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin speaker that looks like a football, so you can understand how it's easy for guests to get confused.)\n(Image credit: Future)\nAs well as looking stylish, it's very functional. Levoit has added wheels underneath, which make it easy to roll the whole thing around (it weighs 20.7lbs / 9.4kg, so it's not really heavy, but I wouldn't want to pick it up). Some purifiers have to be turned upside down to access and remove the filter. However, with this air purifier, I merely need to gently pull the panel door and it comes off immediately.\nI also appreciate the fact the vents are adjustable, enabling me to customize my airflow. By touching the Angle icon, I can choose to set the vent angle to 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees or 90 degrees. So if I put the air purifier under my kitchen island, I can angle the vent so the clean air flows out and away from the island rather than blowing upwards into the bottom of the countertop.\n(Image credit: Future)\nOn the top of the purifier you'll find a touchscreen control panel. With white text and icons on a black background, the display panel is clear and easy to read, and the contrast is sharp enough that the items are visible in bright light as well as no light. On the left hand side of the panel, you'll find options to toggle between three special modes (Sleep, Auto and Turbo), as well as buttons to access 'Air info' and filter info. To the right of the control panel are the controls for speed, vent angle, and the timer function, as well as the on/off button.\nOf course, you don't have to use the touchscreen panel for control if you don't want to. You can also adjust settings using the companion app, where you'll find options to turn the purifier on or off remotely, change the mode, create a schedule, explore air quality, or check on remaining filter life. There's also support for voice control via\nAmazon\nAlexa or\nGoogle\nAssistant.\nDesign score: 4.5 out of 5\nLevoit EverestAir review: performance\nUser-friendly display with useful information\nCleans air quickly and effectively, even in large spaces\nAuto mode works well to detect pollutants\nOne unique feature of the Levoit EverestAir is that it provides a clean air score as a percentage. The air purifier works this number out based on the concentration of particles and changes in detected particles during the purification process. Keep in mind that the clean air percentage is based solely on particles, not odors or gases. Typically, in my home, the score is between 98% and 99%.\nBy default, the Air Info button displays the clean air score as a large percentage, in the center of the control panel, and surrounded by rings that are color-coded to indicate air quality. The ring is blue when the air quality is very good, green when it's good, orange when the air quality is moderate, and red when the air is bad.\nPress the Air Info button again and it'll show you PM (particulate matter) information. One press shows PM 1.0 (fine dust, micro-toxins), a second press shows PM 2.5 (dust, smoke, pet dander), and a third press shows PM 10 air info (pollen, airborne allergens).\n(Image credit: Future)\nWhen the air purifier is in Auto mode, it will automatically detect a change in the air's quality and boost or lower the airflow in response. There have been plenty of occasions where I've noticed a change in fan speed, looked down to see what was happening, and noticed that the air quality indicator rings had turned orange. That usually means my neighbor is smoking, and the air purifier is working hard to clean my air.\nThe Levoit EverestAir does an excellent job of removing pollutants from the air. That's due, in part, to the combination of filters. The washable pre-filter captures dust, lint, hair, and pet fur. I love to see pre-filters on an air purifier, because they help to extend the lifespan of the filter.\nBehind the pre-filter is the\nH13 True HEPA\nmain filter, and it is designed to trap such pollutants as fine dust, smoke, pollen, and pet dander. Lastly, the high-efficiency activator carbon filter is what makes the air smell so clean. The carbon absorbs smoke, fumes, and odors, ranging from secondhand smoke to smells from food and pets.\n(Image credit: Future)\nThe average air purifier has a CADR (clean air delivery rate) in the 200 range. However, the Levoit EverestAir has a much higher CADR: 354 CFM (cubic feet per minute). In my bedroom, the air purifier can clean/change the air around 5 times per hour when it's on the highest setting and my bedroom door is closed. In the living room, which is open to the kitchen and the steps leading downstairs, it cleans the air around twice an hour.\nThe Levoit EverestAir does an excellent job of clearing odors. This is due, in part, to the activated carbon filter, which is specifically designed to absorb odors. One pleasant surprise I discovered as I was testing: most air purifiers have to be set on high to clean the air and remove odors. However, even on a medium setting, the Levoit EverestAir effectively cleans the air.\nFor the purposes of this review, I recorded how long it took for the purfier to clear the smell of second-hand smoke in various spots in my home. It completely removed smoke from my bedroom in roughly 10 to 12 minutes, and took 20-30 minutes to clear the smell from my large, open-plan living space.\n(Image credit: Future)\nDon't let anyone fool you. Air purifiers on high tend to be noisy. On Turbo, this one gets quite loud as well – although not as loud as many others that I've tested. The noise level ranges from 24db on the lowest setting to 56dB on the Turbo setting.\nIf you're looking for a setting that creates minimal disturbance, you'll want to activate Sleep mode. This turns off the display and uses a fan speed that is lower than the Low speed. It's great for people who like to keep the air purifier running all night, but are easily bothered by lights and noise. However, I tended to use a higher setting overnight.\n(Image credit: Levoit / Future)\nAs a general rule, I'm quite happy to manually operate the control panel on the top of the machine. However, for testing purposes, I also downloaded the app to my smartphone and controlled the air purifier by this method. The app was easy to set up and integrated seamlessly, providing the same level of control as the touch controls.\nRegarding maintenance, every two to four weeks, I've wiped the exterior with a dry cloth, and vacuumed the pre-filter. On other occasions, I've also rinsed the pre-filter in the sink, and washed it with a damp cloth and liquid detergent. Every three months I use the vacuum cleaner attachment to clean the dust sensor on the side of the air purifier.\nThe process for changing the filter is really easy and entails removing the front cover, removing the old filter, cleaning any dust or hair with a vacuum hose, and inserting the new filter.\nPerformance score: 5 out of 5\nShould you buy the Levoit EverestAir?\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\nAttribute\nNotes\nRating\nValue\nIt's not a budget pick but considering the features, it's well worth the money.\n4.5 / 5\nDesign\nSlim and compact considering how powerful it is.

Not everyone wants that level of insight or control – and there are plenty of simpler options if that includes you.\nHow I tested the Levoit EverestAir purifier\nI've been using the Levoit EverestAir in my home for the past two years and 5 months. My house was built in 2016 and includes an open living room/kitchen and two bedrooms, and a HVAC system. During this time, I've used the EverestAir in the living room/kitchen to clear cooking smells and second-hand smoke from my neighbor. I’ve also used it – to great success – in my bedroom.\nFor this review, I made note of how quickly it responded to and cleared pollutants. I also explored all the various special modes and control options, including digging into the companion app. I compared my findings to other air purifiers I've tested – I've reviewed over 50 different models in my years as a consumer tech journalist – to get a feel for how it compares to the wider market and if it offers good value for the money.\nFirst reviewed October 2025\nLevoit EverestAir Smart Air Purifier: Price Comparison\n$499.99\n$349.99\nView\n$499.99\n$349.99\nView\n$528.49\nView\nWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices\npowered by\nTerri Williams\nSocial Links Navigation\nTerri is a freelance writer living in Birmingham, AL.

Right now, the Kindle Kids (\nAmazon\n,\nBest Buy\n, and\nTarget\n) and Kindle Colorsoft Kids (\nAmazon\n,\nBest Buy\n, and\nTarget\n) are down to their lowest prices ever, but my favorite deal is on the\nKindle Paperwhite Kids\n, which sits nicely between the two. Normally $179.99, right now it’s on sale for $134.99 ($45 off) at\nAmazon\n,\nBest Buy\n, and\nTarget\n.\nAlthough marketed as a kid-friendly e-reader, the Paperwhite Kids is actually a great value for adults, too. The 7-inch slate is nearly identical to the standard model, which is our\nfavorite Amazon e-reader\n, with all the features we loved, like an IPX8 waterproof design and sharp 300ppi display. It’s got an adjustable warm white frontlight, which makes reading at night easier, too, along with a battery life that should last you a few months on a single charge.\nThe only real difference is the addition of kid-oriented features like parental controls, which you can turn off. Unlike the standard model, each bundle also includes a cover, a two-year warranty, and no lockscreen ads. That’s a great value considering the regular Kindle Paperwhite costs $179.99 without ads — and still doesn’t include extras like a cover or extended warranty. On top of that, Amazon even throws in a six-month subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, which offers thousands of child-friendly books and audiobooks — including classics like\nHarry Potter\nand\nThe Chronicles of Narnia\n.\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite review\n.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids (2024)\n$\n135\n$\n180\n25\n% off\n$\n135\nAmazon’s kid-friendly Paperwhite is the same as the standard Paperwhite, but it’s ad-free and comes with the added benefits of a two-year hardware protection plan, six months of Amazon Kids Plus, and a choice of three kid-friendly covers.\nRead More\n$135 at Amazon\n$135 at Best Buy\n$135 at Target\nNow through October 6th,\nSonos is taking up to 25 percent off\na wide range of refurbished devices. As\nwe dove into earlier in the week\n, the sale includes everything from a refurbished\nSonos Ace\nto the\nSonos Move 2\n, but one of the best deals is the refurbished\nSonos Era 100\n. Normally $219 in new condition, the smart speaker is currently\ndown to $134\n, which is nearly as low as the $119 discount we saw on the refurbished model over the summer.\nThe Sonos Era 100 delivers impressive sound for its small size, offering more bass and richer sound than its predecessor, the Sonos One. Along with more intuitive physical controls, it also adds new features like stereo playback and support for line-in via an optional 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter. At the same time, the smart speaker retains support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, along with other conveniences, like Apple’s AirPlay 2 and Amazon Alexa support.\nRead our Sonos Era 100 review\n.\nSonos Era 100 (Refurbished)\n$\n134\n$\n179\n25\n% off\n$\n134\nSonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer.

It introduces a number of improvements over its predecessor, replacing its Hall effect joysticks with tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ones, which are just as drift-resistant but more power-efficient. It also adds trigger stops along with LED-equipped joystick rings and an extra pair of shoulder buttons for added control.\n8BitDo Ultimate 2 wireless controller\n$\n60\n$\n70\n14\n% off\n$\n60\nFor something cheaper — and in some ways better — than Nintendo’s official Pro controller, there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2, which works with the original Switch and Switch 2.

The Ultimate tier is jumping from $19.99 per month to $29.99, while PC Game Pass is rising from $11.99 to $16.49 per month if you pay through Microsoft. That said, you can still save by buying through third-party retailers offering the old rates. You can get a month of Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99 at\nAmazon\n,\nGameStop\n, or\nBest Buy\n, or a three-month subscription for $59.99 (\nAmazon\n,\nGameStop\n,\nBest Buy\n, and\nWalmart\n), which is like getting one month free at the current rate.

The Spot makes for a great bedside alarm clock, gently waking you with music if you choose, while its customizable 2.83-inch screen can show helpful info like the weather so you’re ready for the day. It also supports Amazon Alexa, so you can not only play music but also control other smart devices — like lights, thermostats, and more — hands-free. Plus, it doesn’t come with a bunch of on-screen ads or a camera, making it a relatively privacy-friendly option compared to Amazon’s larger smart displays.\nRead our Echo Spot review\n.\nJBL’s Tour 3 earbuds\nare on sale for $249.95 ($80 off) at\nAmazon\n,\nBest Buy\n, and\nTarget\n, which is their best price yet.

    "source": "Featured\nReplacing coders with AI? Why Bill Gates, Sam Altman and experience say you shouldn’t.\nDerek Chang, Stratus Data\nOctober 5, 2025\nIn the race to automate everything – from customer service to code –\nAI is being heralded as a silver bullet\n. The narrative is seductive: AI tools that can write entire applications, streamline engineering teams and reduce the need for expensive human developers, along with hundreds of other jobs.\nBut from my point of view as a technologist who spends every day inside real companies’ data and workflows, the hype doesn’t match up with the reality.\nI’ve worked with industry leaders like General Electric, The Walt Disney Company and Harvard Medical School to optimize their data and AI infrastructure, and here’s what I’ve learned:\nReplacing humans with AI in most jobs is still just an idea on the horizon.\nI worry that we're thinking too far ahead. In the past two years,\nmore than a quarter\nof programming jobs have vanished. Mark Zuckerberg\nannounced\nhe is planning to replace many of Meta’s coders with AI.\nBut, intriguingly, both Bill Gates and Sam Altman have\npublicly warned\nagainst replacing coders.\nRight now, we shouldn’t count on\nAI tools\nto successfully replace jobs in tech or business. That’s because what AI knows is inherently limited by what it has seen – and most of what it has seen in the tech world is boilerplate.\nGenerative AI models are trained on large datasets, which typically fall into two main categories: publicly available data (from the open internet), or proprietary or licensed data (created in-house by the organization, or purchased from third parties).\nSimple tasks, like building a basic website or configuring a template app, are easy wins for generative models. But when it comes to writing the sophisticated, proprietary infrastructure code that powers companies like Google or Stripe, there’s a problem: That code doesn’t exist in public repositories. It’s locked away inside the walls of corporations, inaccessible to training data and often written by engineers with decades of experience.\nRight now, AI\ncan’t reason\non its own yet. And it doesn’t have instincts. It’s just mimicking patterns. A friend of mine in the tech world once described large language models (LLMs) as a \"really good guesser.\"\nThink of AI today as a junior team member — helpful for a first draft or simple projects. But like any junior, it requires oversight. In programming, for example, while I’ve found a 5X improvement for simple coding, I’ve found that reviewing and correcting more complicated AI-produced code often takes more time and energy than writing the code myself.\nYou still need senior professionals with deep experience to find the flaws, and to understand the nuances of how those flaws might pose a risk six months from now.\nThat’s not to say AI shouldn’t have a place in the workplace. But the dream of replacing entire teams of programmers or accountants or marketers with one human and a host of AI tools is far premature. We still need senior-level people in these jobs, and we need to train people in junior-level jobs to be technically capable enough to assume the more complex roles one day.\nThe goal of AI in tech and business shouldn’t be about removing humans from the loop. I’m not saying this because I’m scared AI will take my job. I’m saying it because I’ve seen how dangerous\ntrusting AI too much\nat this stage can be.\nBusiness leaders, no matter what industry they’re in, should be aware: While AI promises cost savings and smaller teams, these efficiency gains could backfire. You might trust AI to perform more junior levels of work, but not to complete more sophisticated projects.\nAI is fast. Humans are smart. There’s a big difference. The sooner we shift the conversation from replacing humans to reinforcing them, the more we’ll reap the benefits of AI.\nDerek Chang is founding partner of\nStratus Data\n.\nSubscribe to get latest news!\nDeep insights for enterprise AI, data, and security leaders\nVB Daily\nAI Weekly\nAGI Weekly\nSecurity Weekly\nData Infrastructure Weekly\nVB Events\nAll of them\nGet updates\nYou're in!

Chang, drawing from his experience with industry leaders, emphasizes that AI currently functions as a junior team member requiring oversight, and that senior professionals are still crucial for identifying flaws and understanding long-term risks. He warns business leaders that over-reliance on AI for sophisticated projects could backfire, advocating for a shift from replacing humans to reinforcing them to maximize AI's benefits.",

That backlash can be especially strong if you’re giving a facelift to a decades-old piece of software beloved by nerds around the globe. So, it was no surprise that when Audacity revealed its new logo people on the internet got a little\nworked up\n. And look, there’s no two ways about it, the logo is pretty bad. The font it quite nice, but the bewildering take on its traditional headphone icon is rough.\nReactions around\nThe Verge\nnewsroom included “looks like someone stepped on the apple music icon,” and “trying to decide if their new logo looks like a sperm, and am mostly coming up with yes.” But if you can get past the branding,\nAudacity 4\nactually looks like it’s going to be a much needed upgrade.\nMartin Keary, VP of product at Muse, posted a nearly\nhour long video\nto YouTube detailing the challenges facing Audacity, the logic behind the design changes, and updates on the development of version 4 (slated for release in early 2026). One of the biggest improvements is in minimizing what Keary calls “Audacity says ‘no’”. These are things that Audacity simply won’t let you do, often with no explanation other than a simple pop up (if you’re lucky). He lists off a number of examples:\nIf you want to drag a clip past another clip, it hits it like a brick wall. No. If you copy a clip and try to paste it where there’s not enough blank runway, no. You don’t have enough room. If you wanted to select multiple clips… no.\nCleaning this up involved changing the behavior of the UI, like automatically trimming a clip if you paste something over it, and getting rid of a bunch of “modes” that limited how you could interact with audio. The team also added meters for individual tracks, made trimming and time stretching easier to find (just click and drag the edge of the clip), and added a split tool that makes cleaning up audio a bit easier.\nSome users might be upset that the Sync Lock feature is going away but, as a long time user of Audacity, I can confirm it’s a confusing mess. Working with and keeping multiple audio tracks in sync is a difficult challenge to tackle, but the approached laid out in version 4 makes a lot more sense (to me at least). Add to this a more customizable, modern interface that’s much easier to read and Audacity 4 looks like it’s actually shaping up to be major step forward for the stalwart audio editor. Lets just hope they revisit the branding before the proper release in 2026.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nTerrence O'Brien\nClose\nTerrence O'Brien\nWeekend Editor\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nTerrence O'Brien\nApps\nClose\nApps\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nApps\nDesign\nClose\nDesign\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nDesign\nNews\nClose\nNews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nNews\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nShein is opening its first physical stores\nTilly Norwood is a gen AI psyop\nTesla’s cheaper Model Y finally breaks cover\nDiscord customer service data breach leaks user info and scanned photo IDs\nApple pulls ICEBlock from the App Store\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

So \"can you explain more about what they're saying right now\" will automatically surface the relevant portion of the video and provide that to the underlying AI model for it to analyze and respond to through text.\nIn another example, Christakis opened an older, existing ChatGPT conversation he'd had about his siblings' dog walking business and resumed the conversation by asking another third-party app,\nCanva\n, to generate a poster using one of ChatGPT's recommended business names, \"Walk This Wag,\" along with specific guidance about font choice (\"sans serif\") and overall coloration and style (\"bright and colorful.\")\nInstead of the user manually having to go and add all those specific elements to a Canva template, ChatGPT went and issued the commands and performed the actions on behalf of the user in the background.\nAfter a few minutes, ChatGPT responded with several poster designs generated directly within the Canva app, but displayed them all in the user's ChatGPT chat session where they could see, review, enlarge and provide feedback or ask for adjustments on all of them.\nChristakis then asked for ChatGPT to turn one of the slides into an entire slide deck so the founders of the dog walking business could present it to investors, which did it in the background over several minutes while he presented a final integrated app,\nZillow\n.\nHe started a new chat session and asked a simple question: \"based on our conversations, what would be a good city to expand the dog walking business.\"\nUsing ChatGPT's optional memory feature, it referenced the dog walk conversation and suggested Pittsburgh, which Christakis used as a chance to type in \"Zillow\" and \"show me some homes for sale there,\" which called up an interactive map from Zillow with homes for sale and prices listed and hover-over animations, all in-line within ChatGPT.\nClicking a specific home also opened a fullscreen view with \"most of the Zillow experience,\" entirely without leaving ChatGPT, including the ability to request home tours and contact agents and filtering by bedrooms and other qualities like outdoor space. ChatGPT pulls up the requested filtered Zillow search as well as provides a text-based response in-line explaining what it did and why.\nThe user can then ask follow-up questions about the specific property — such as \"how close is it to a dog park?\" — or compare it to other properties, all within ChatGPT.\nIt can also use apps in conjunction with its Search function, searching the web to compare the app information (in this case, Zillow) with other sources.\nSafety, privacy, and developer standards\nOpenAI emphasized that\napps must comply with strict privacy, safety, and content\nstandards\nto be listed in the ChatGPT directory. Apps must:\nserve a\nclear and valuable purpose\nbe\npredictable and reliable\nin behavior\nbe\nsafe for general audiences\n, including teens aged 13–17\nrespect user privacy\nand limit data collection to only what’s necessary\nEvery app must also include a\nclear, published privacy policy\n, obtain user consent before connecting, and identify any actions that modify external data (e.g., posting, sending, uploading).\nApps violating OpenAI’s usage policies, crashing frequently, or misrepresenting their capabilities may be removed at any time.

Shin is the first author of a new study in Nature Neuroscience that has identified a specific population of neurons in the visual cortex—dubbed IC-encoders—and shows their direct role in representing a visual illusion. The work is the result of a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Allen Institute in Seattle, and Seoul National University.\nWhat the brain “knows”\nIllusory contours are edges we see even though they aren’t physically there. A classic example is the\nKanizsa triangle\n: three “Pac-Man” shapes make us perceive a bright white triangle floating on top. Hide the Pac-Men with your fingers and the trick is revealed: There is no border, just a uniform background. Neurophysiology agrees with perception here: For over 20 years, studies in primates and later imaging in humans and mice have described neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond to real and illusory contours.\nCredit:\nWikimedia Commons\nIf the edges don’t exist in the stimulus, the brain must be filling them in. That’s tricky to explain in a purely “bottom-up” view of perception, where the visual system would just act like a camera, faithfully processing the input from the retina. But even at the very first stages, the visual system doesn’t just passively record—it integrates local and long-range neural signals and draws on prior knowledge (like statistical regularities of the visual world) to guide its interpretations. In other words, it makes “assumptions” about what we’re seeing based on what it already knows.\nThe new study pinpoints the neurons that encode some of these inferences. To find them, the researchers combined cutting-edge brain imaging with a crucial causal test: directly poking the neurons to see what happened.\nWatching and poking neurons\nThe first part of the study, done with the\nAllen Institute’s OpenScope program\n, used high-density silicon probes to record large-scale electrical activity across visual areas of mouse brains, capturing the activity of hundreds of neurons with sub-millisecond precision as the mice viewed stimuli that included illusory contours.\nThat technique has superb temporal resolution, but it can’t easily distinguish the properties of individual cells. So the team also recorded the activity of thousands of neurons in the upper layers of the visual cortex using a calcium-sensitive fluorescent molecule. This produced what Hillel Adesnik of UC Berkeley calls “dynamic pictures of the brain activity where neurons flash when they fire.”\nUsing illusions\nUsing visual illusions as a crowbar to pry open the brain’s active construction of our perceptual world isn’t new, and Shin and colleagues are just the latest in a long line of researchers to tap them. For more than a century, those seemingly amusing “errors” have been a workhorse for revealing otherwise invisible processes. Even if they look like curiosities, “illusory contours are just very convenient tools. They provoke strong perception, and this allows us to link perception to possible neural mechanisms,” Adesnik says. “They can tell us a lot about how we perceive objects under occlusion and in less-than-ideal, real-world conditions—say, in dim light or low contrast.”\nTogether, these approaches not only mapped activity but also identified the specific neurons to target in the next phase with optogenetics. This technique introduces the gene encoding a light-sensitive protein into the genomes of neurons, allowing light to act like an on/off switch. Shine light, and neurons fire. Adesnik’s group took this a step further, using holographic 3D illumination: “We used an optical system that shapes the light in three dimensions that allowed us to target very specific neurons,” he says.\nThis allowed them to stimulate a tiny, very selective subset: “Out of approximately 5,000 neurons, we were able to selectively target the 20 most responsive to, for example, encoding illusory contours.” By combining this stimulation with cortical recordings, the team could move beyond simply correlating neural activity with a stimulus. As Adesnik puts it: “rather than working with a purely observational approach, we could actually photo-stimulate and activate those particular neurons as a group and observe how that influences neural dynamics.”\nBy photo-stimulating the IC-encoders, the researchers were able to re-create the same neural activity patterns normally evoked by illusory edges, even in the absence of any visual input. In other words, activating this population was enough to generate the specific ‘border’ signal in the visual circuit, not just a generic burst of activity. This suggests IC-encoders don’t just follow sensory input—they actively build the representation of edges that aren’t physically there.\nEarlier work had hinted at such cells, but Shin and colleagues show systematically that they’re not rare oddballs—they’re a well-defined, functionally important subpopulation. “What we didn’t know is that these neurons drive local pattern completion within primary visual cortex,” says Shin. “We showed that those cells are causally involved in this pattern completion process that we speculate is likely involved in the perceptual process of illusory contours,” adds Adesnik.\nBehavioral tests still to come\nThat doesn’t mean the mice “saw” the illusory contours when the neurons were artificially activated. “We didn’t actually measure behavior in this study,” says Adesnik. “It was about the neural representation.” All we can say at this point is that the IC-encoders could induce neural activity patterns that matched what imaging shows during normal perception of illusory contours.\n“It’s possible that the mice weren’t seeing them,” admits Shin, “because the technique has involved a relatively small number of neurons, for technical limitations. But in the future, one could expand the number of neurons and also introduce behavioral tests.”\nThat’s the next frontier, Adesnik says: “What we would do is photo-stimulate these neurons and see if we can generate an animal’s behavioral response even without any stimulus on the screen.” Right now, optogenetics can only drive a small number of neurons, and IC-encoders are relatively rare and scattered. “For now, we have only stimulated a small number of these detectors, mainly because of technical limitations. IC-encoders are a rare population, probably distributed through the layers [of the visual system], but we could imagine an experiment where we recruit three, four, five, maybe even 10 times as many neurons,” he says. “In this case, I think we might be able to start getting behavioral responses. We’d definitely very much like to do this test.”\nNature Neuroscience, 2025.

The newest feature makes ChatGPT a conversational app store with potentially huge ramifications for how people engage with it.\nChatGPT has been moving toward a more proactive approach to answering requests for a while, but the inclusion of third-party apps provided by the likes of Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow, makes it so you can simply mention a task in a chat and ChatGPT can now call on the relevant services without you needing to click on a link. For instance, you could ask for a new Spotify playlist or help make a real estate listing for Zillow and have it set up on those respective platforms without leaving ChatGPT.\nAnd you don't even have to specify which app you want. Mention planning a trip, and ChatGPT might suggest the Expedia or Booking.com app. Or if you're asking about designing a logo, you might see Figma appear as part of ChatGPT's answer. ChatGPT becomes a central command center where conversations turn into actions with a single prompt.\nYou may like\nOpenAI claims the new ChatGPT agent can run your errands, build your slides, and make you look like you have your life together\n5 ways ChatGPT Agent can change the way you use AI\nGPT-5 is here – 5 things you need to know about OpenAI’s ‘most useful’ model yet\nThe obvious comparison here is to smartphones and the early days of the\nApple\nApp Store. But even on your phone, you have to go find and open an app to use it. With ChatGPT apps, the software comes to you based on context as much as by name. You don't open the app. The app joins the conversation.\nOf course, it’s also a power play by OpenAI. After all, becoming a platform, OpenAI now owns the interface and possibly the app economy within it. Much like how\nGoogle\ncontrols search traffic or how Apple controls mobile distribution, OpenAI could soon determine which apps appear in ChatGPT, how they’re ranked, and what it takes to be discoverable.\nChatGPT OS\nThe change is rolling out today for all ChatGPT users, except those within the EU for now. OpenAI says it plans to expand the roster of third-party partners throughout the year, aided by how developers can start building their own apps right now using the SDK. OpenAI hasn’t yet laid out exactly how app developers will earn money from this new ecosystem, but a revenue model is inevitable.\nFrom the user’s perspective, using one of these new ChatGPT apps looks less like installing software and more like inviting a useful guest into your chat. The first time you use a new app, ChatGPT will ask for permission and show you what data it plans to share, with a prompt to connect your accounts if needed. Once connected, these apps are interactive and will offer all sorts of help based on what you've discussed with ChatGPT.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nStill, if OpenAI’s vision pans out, we may look back on today as the day AI stopped being a service and started becoming a storefront.\nFollow TechRadar on Google News\nand\nadd us as a preferred source\nto get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

Its latest creation seems straight out of an alternate dimension where touch-tone technology never replaced rotary phones, and that functionality eventually found its way into other devices.\nInstead of keys, the\nGboard Dial Version keyboard\nfeatures various alphanumeric characters and functions laid out beneath a series of nine dials of various sizes, including one just for the return key. To type a specific character, you stick your finger in its corresponding hole and then rotate the dial until you reach its limit. When you release it, the dial rotates back.\nYou won’t be setting any typing speed records on Google Japan’s new concept keyboard.\nImage: YouTube / Google Japan\nRotary phones used a technique called pulse dialing, where a spring-loaded dial generated a series of electrical pulses as it rotated back to its home position. The phone company would decode those pulses to determine what number was being dialed. Google Japan’s Gboard Dial Version trades pulse dialing for modern sensors that translate each dial’s rotational movements into USB signals.\nAn accompanying accessory lets you turn off your camera during video calls by placing your mouse on a stand.\nImage: YouTube / Google Japan\nAnd similar to the phones of yesteryear that ended a call when you physically hung them up, the dial keyboard’s designers created an accompanying stand that turns off your webcam during a video call when you place your mouse atop it.\nAs with Google Japan’s past creations that have included a\ncylindrical keyboard in the shape of a Japanese Yunomi tea cup\nand a\n65-inch-long monstrosity\nwith all the keys of a QWERTY keyboard arranged in one long strip, the Dial Version isn’t available for sale. But if you really want to obliterate your typing speed, you’re welcome to build your own. Google has open-sourced its design, and you can find all the files needed to DIY one, including 3D printer models, PCB designs, and a parts list,\navailable for download on GitHub\n.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nAndrew Liszewski\nClose\nAndrew Liszewski\nSenior Reporter, News\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nAndrew Liszewski\nDesign\nClose\nDesign\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nDesign\nGoogle\nClose\nGoogle\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGoogle\nKeyboards\nClose\nKeyboards\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nKeyboards\nNews\nClose\nNews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nNews\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMore in this stream\nSee all\nRefine your own macrodata for the low, low price of $899.\nDominic Preston\nJul 18\nHow to build the best keyboard in the world\nNathan Edwards\nJun 15\nNorbauer Seneca review: a $3,600 luxury keyboard for the keyboard obsessed\nNathan Edwards\nJun 15\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nShein is opening its first physical stores\nIf you can get past the terrible logo, Audacity 4 looks pretty great\nRivian CEO: ‘We’re really convicted’ about skipping CarPlay\nJane Goodall’s death triggered the premiere of Netflix’s new show\nCan tap-to-pay save public transportation?\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad"

OpenAI announced the integration, which is enabled by the company’s new\nApps SDK\n, during its DevDay presentation. As of today, ChatGPT can connect to a handful of apps, with more to come over time and OpenAI working on submission guidelines that will allow developers to monetize their work.\nAs a ChatGPT user, you can any access available third-party app by referencing it in your conversations with the chatbot. In the\ncase of Spotify\n, for example, you can write “Spotify, make a playlist for my party this Friday.” The first time you mention an app in this way, you’ll be prompted to connect your account to ChatGPT. When working with Spotify, ChatGPT can make recommendations based on a mood, theme or a topic. The interface will eventually lead you to Spotify itself, where you can listen to what ChatGPT has created.\n“It’s early days, so while we might not be able to deliver on every request just yet, we’ll continue to build, refine, and improve the experience over the coming weeks and months,” Spotify says of the integration.\nOpenAI showed off other apps working inside of ChatGPT. For instance, an employee demoed Canva creating a few posters for a dog-walking business that they had talked to ChatGPT about starting. With today’s announcement, ChatGPT can connect to Canva, Coursera, Figma, Spotify and Zillow. In the coming weeks, DoorDash, OpenTable, Target and Uber will also work with the chatbot. And later this year, OpenAI says it will begin accepting app submissions for review and publication.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads"

    "source": "Google is\nexpanding access to Opal\n, its AI\nvibe-coding app\n, to 15 more countries. The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panamá, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan.\n“When we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,” said Megan Li, a Senior Product Manager at Google Labs, in a\nblog post\n. “We didn’t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.”\nOpal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal’s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts.\nIn addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal.\nThe tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork.\nGoogle also says that it’s made significant improvements to Opal’s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it’s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously.\nWith the U.S. launch of Opal in July, Google joined a growing list of competitors including Canva, Figma, and Replit that are building tools to help nontechnical users design app prototypes without writing any code.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nAI\n,\nApps\n,\nApps\n,\nGoogle\n,\nopal\nAisha Malik\nConsumer News Reporter\nAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panamá, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan.\n“When we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,” said Megan Li, a Senior Product Manager at Google Labs, in a\nblog post\n. “We didn’t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.”\nOpal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal’s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts.\nIn addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal.\nThe tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork.\nGoogle also says that it’s made significant improvements to Opal’s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it’s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously.\nWith the U.S.",

    "source": "Has this stealth startup finally cracked the code on enterprise AI agent reliability? Meet AUI's Apollo-1\nCarl Franzen\nOctober 7, 2025\nFor more than a decade, conversational AI has promised human-like assistants that can do more than chat. Yet even as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude learn to reason, explain, and code, one critical category of interaction remains largely unsolved — reliably completing tasks for people\noutside of chat\n.\nEven the\nbest AI models score only in the\n30th percentile on Terminal-Bench Hard,\na third-party benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI agents on completing a variety of browser-based tasks, far below the reliability demanded by most enterprises and users. And task-specific benchmarks\nlike TAU-Bench airline,\nwhich measures the\nreliability of AI agents on finding and booking flights\non behalf of a user, also don't have much higher pass rates, with\nonly 56% for the top performing agents and models\n(Claude 3.7 Sonnet) — meaning the agent fails nearly half the time.\nNew York City-based\nAugmented Intelligence (AUI) Inc.\n, co-founded by\nOhad Elhelo\nand\nOri Cohen\n, believes it has finally come with a solution to boost AI agent reliability to a level where most enterprises can trust they will do as instructed, reliably.\nThe company’s new foundation model, called\nApollo-1\n— which remains in preview with early testers now but is close to an impending general release — is built on a principle it calls\nstateful neuro-symbolic reasoning.\nIt's a hybrid architecture championed by even\nLLM skeptics like Gary Marcus\n, designed to guarantee consistent, policy-compliant outcomes in every customer interaction.\n“Conversational AI is essentially two halves,” said Elhelo in a recent interview with VentureBeat. “The first half — open-ended dialogue — is handled beautifully by LLMs. They’re designed for creative or exploratory use cases. The other half is task-oriented dialogue, where there’s always a specific goal behind the conversation. That half has remained unsolved because it requires certainty.”\nAUI defines\ncertainty\nas the difference between an agent that “probably” performs a task and one that almost “always” does.\nFor example, on\nTAU-Bench Airline, it performs at a staggering 92.5% pass rate\n, leaving all the other current competitors far behind in the dust — according to benchmarks shared with VentureBeat and\nposted on AUI's website.\nElhelo offered simple examples: a bank that must enforce ID verification for refunds over $200, or an airline that must always offer a business-class upgrade before economy.\n“Those aren’t preferences,” he said. “They’re requirements. And no purely generative approach can deliver that kind of behavioral certainty.”\nAUI and its work on improving reliability was previously covered by subscription news outlet\nThe Information\n, but has not received widespread coverage in publicly accessible media — until now.\nFrom Pattern Matching to Predictable Action\nThe team argues that transformer models, by design, can’t meet that bar. Large language models generate plausible text, not guaranteed behavior. “When you tell an LLM to always offer insurance before payment, it might — usually,” Elhelo said. “Configure Apollo-1 with that rule, and it will — every time.”\nThat distinction, he said, stems from the architecture itself. Transformers predict the next token in a sequence. Apollo-1, by contrast, predicts the\nnext action\nin a conversation, operating on what AUI calls a\ntyped symbolic state\n.\nCohen explained the idea in more technical terms. “Neuro-symbolic means we’re merging the two dominant paradigms,” he said. “The symbolic layer gives you structure — it knows what an intent, an entity, and a parameter are — while the neural layer gives you language fluency. The neuro-symbolic reasoner sits between them. It’s a different kind of brain for dialogue.”\nWhere transformers treat every output as text generation, Apollo-1 runs a closed reasoning loop: an encoder translates natural language into a symbolic state, a state machine maintains that state, a decision engine determines the next action, a planner executes it, and a decoder turns the result back into language. “The process is iterative,” Cohen said. “It loops until the task is done. That’s how you get determinism instead of probability.”\nA Foundation Model for Task Execution\nUnlike traditional chatbots or bespoke automation systems, Apollo-1 is meant to serve as a\nfoundation model\nfor task-oriented dialogue — a single, domain-agnostic system that can be configured for banking, travel, retail, or insurance through what AUI calls a\nSystem Prompt\n.\n“The System Prompt isn’t a configuration file,” Elhelo said. “It’s a behavioral contract. You define exactly how your agent must behave in situations of interest, and Apollo-1 guarantees those behaviors will execute.”\nOrganizations can use the prompt to encode symbolic slots — intents, parameters, and policies — as well as tool boundaries and state-dependent rules.\nA food delivery app, for example, might enforce “if allergy mentioned, always inform the restaurant,” while a telecom provider might define “after three failed payment attempts, suspend service.” In both cases, the behavior executes deterministically, not statistically.\nEight Years in the Making\nAUI’s path to Apollo-1 began in 2017, when the team started encoding millions of real task-oriented conversations handled by a 60,000-person human agent workforce.\nThat work led to a symbolic language capable of separating\nprocedural knowledge\n— steps, constraints, and flows — from\ndescriptive knowledge\nlike entities and attributes.\n“The insight was that task-oriented dialogue has universal procedural patterns,” said Elhelo. “Food delivery, claims processing, and order management all share similar structures. Once you model that explicitly, you can compute over it deterministically.”\nFrom there, the company built the neuro-symbolic reasoner — a system that uses the symbolic state to decide what happens next rather than guessing through token prediction.\nBenchmarks suggest the architecture makes a measurable difference.\nIn AUI’s own evaluations, Apollo-1 achieved over\n90 percent\ntask completion on the τ-Bench-Airline benchmark, compared with\n60 percent\nfor Claude-4.\nIt completed\n83 percent\nof live booking chats on Google Flights versus\n22 percent\nfor Gemini 2.5-Flash, and\n91 percent\nof retail scenarios on Amazon versus\n17 percent\nfor Rufus.\n“These aren’t incremental improvements,” said Cohen. “They’re order-of-magnitude reliability differences.”\nA Complement, Not a Competitor\nAUI isn’t pitching Apollo-1 as a replacement for large language models, but as their necessary counterpart. In Elhelo’s words: “Transformers optimize for creative probability. Apollo-1 optimizes for behavioral certainty. Together, they form the complete spectrum of conversational AI.”\nThe model is already running in limited pilots with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies across sectors including finance, travel, and retail.\nAUI has also confirmed a\nstrategic partnership with Google\nand plans for\ngeneral availability in November 2025\n, when it will open APIs, release full documentation, and add voice and image capabilities. Interested potential customers and partners can sign up to receive more information when it\nbecomes available on AUI's website form.\nUntil then, the company is keeping details under wraps. When asked about what comes next, Elhelo smiled. “Let’s just say we’re preparing an announcement,” he said. “Soon.”\nToward Conversations That Act\nFor all its technical sophistication, Apollo-1’s pitch is simple: make AI that businesses can trust to act — not just talk. “We’re on a mission to democratize access to AI that works,” Cohen said near the end of the interview.\nWhether Apollo-1 becomes the new standard for task-oriented dialogue remains to be seen. But if AUI’s architecture performs as promised, the long-standing divide between chatbots that sound human and agents that reliably do human work may finally start to close.\nSubscribe to get latest news!\nDeep insights for enterprise AI, data, and security leaders\nVB Daily\nAI Weekly\nAGI Weekly\nSecurity Weekly\nData Infrastructure Weekly\nVB Events\nAll of them\nGet updates\nYou're in!

We’ve rounded up the best offers we could find below, including lower-than-usual prices on\ngaming mice\n,\nheadsets\n, controllers and actual games we recommend. Just remember that the Prime Big Deal Days sale, as it’s officially called, runs October 7 and 8 and keeps some deals exclusive for Prime members.\nPlayStation\nDeath Stranding 2: On The Beach\n$50\n$70\nSave $20\nThe latest adventure from\nMetal Gear Solid\ncreator Hideo Kojima,\nDeath Stranding 2\nis both a delivery sim deeply fixated on how we interact with landscapes and a massively indulgent melodrama that you’ll either find endearing or unbearable depending on your persuasion. Either way, it is undeniably earnest. It should also be a bit easier to come to grips with than the original. Outside of that predecessor, there really isn’t another game like it. This deal marks a new low.\n$50 at Amazon\nSplit Fiction\n(Xbox) for $25 ($25 off MSRP)\n: A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games,\nSplit Fiction\nis a imaginative crowd-pleaser that’s designed from the ground up to be played with another person. As in, you literally\nneed\na second person to play it. Like\nIt Takes Two\nbefore it\n, it overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like commitment to presenting new methods of play. This deal for the Xbox copy represents the lowest price we’ve tracked, though the\nPS5 version\nis also on sale for $40 if you’d rather play there.\nElden Ring\n(PS5) for $30 ($20 off)\n: You’ve probably heard about it by now, but the action-RPG\nElden Ring\nis both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in a way few games have. It’s unafraid to test your resolve, yet it always grants you the freedom to simply turn around and find another path forward.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\n(PS5) for $35 ($15 off)\n: Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a\nfavorable review\nlast year. You need to have played\nits predecessor\n— and ideally, the\noriginal PS1 game\n— to get the most out of it, but it’s positively stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best.\nGran Turismo 7\nfor $30 ($40 off)\n:\nGran Turismo 7\nis the PS5’s premier sim racer, and a love letter to automobiles as a whole. Like the rest of the\nGT\nseries, it revels in the patience and precision required to figure out how a given car meshes with a given course. Learning the intricacies of each combination is both intense and rewarding, and there’s a singular style to it all that just doesn’t exist with most sports games.\nReturnal\nfor $30 ($70 off)\n:\nReturnal\nis a third-person shooter roguelike that’s at once a technical showcase, a\nstiff challenge\nand an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It is not for the faint of heart, but its bullet-hell battles are wonderfully fierce, and just about everything in it contributes to its overarching story. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to developer Housemarque’s\nnext game\n,\nSaros\n, which seems to borrow many of the elements introduced here.\nThe Last of Us Part I\nfor $30 ($40 off)\n: The PS5 remake of Sony’s zombie drama is one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made, but if you’ve never played one of the earlier versions, this is the\nbest way to rectify that\n. If you’re looking to play the (even moodier) sequel, the\nPS5 version of that one\nis similarly discounted.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nGod of War Ragnarok\nfor $30 ($40 off)\n:\nRagnarok\nis another Sony sequel that’s more about\nincreasing scope\nthan radically reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully varied and detailed, smashing baddies with a magic axe feels great, and the whole thing is excessive in the way you’d expect a\nGod of War\ngame to be without going overboard.\nHorizon Forbidden West\nfor $30 ($40 off)\n: Engadget’s Jess Conditt called\nHorizon Forbidden West\nthe “\ntotal package\n” in her review a few years back, praising its frenzied combat, gorgeous art direction and complex narrative. It still has one of the more distinctive post-apocalypses in gaming, blending robot beasts with stunning vistas. That helps paper over some less-than-inspired side content and bits of sluggish pacing.\nFinal Fantasy XVI\n(PS5) for $23 ($7 off)\n:\nFinal Fantasy XVI\nis a\nmore straightforward\naction-RPG than something like\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\n: You don’t need to come in with prior knowledge of any other story, and its hack-and-slash combat is simple to pick up. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods\nmelodramatically smack\neach other, and there’s nothing wrong with that.\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon\nfor $20 ($10 off)\n:\nArmored Core VI\nis a big loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It rules. But it’s not mindless: Its many boss fights are genuine duels, and it’s deeply flexible in how it lets you tweak your death machine to tackle stages in different ways. This ties the best price we've seen for the PS5 version.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nMetaphor: ReFantazio\n(Xbox) for $16 ($54 off)\n: It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “\nMetaphor\n” to be, but the latest from the minds behind\nPersona 5\nis a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and deeply earnest. (And long.) This deal represents a new low, though it only applies to the Xbox copy.\nMadden NFL 26\nfor $37 ($33 off)\n: It always feels like\nMadden\ncould use a creative reset, but at the end of the day, it’s\nMadden\n, and it works fine enough if you just want to scratch the pro football game itch. This is the largest discount we’ve seen for the latest entry, and it applies to the PS5, Xbox and Switch 2 copies.\nMeta\nMeta Quest 3S (128GB)\n$249\n$299\nSave $50\nThe Quest 3S is the budget pick in our guide to the\nbest VR headsets\n. Its older Fresnel lenses aren’t exactly class-leading, but they’re good enough for those new to VR, and the headset as a whole is just as fast and comfortable as the pricier Quest 3. It supports the same games and apps, too. This deal ties the best widely available discount we’ve seen for the 128GB model. A configuration with twice the storage and a copy of the game\nBatman: Arkham Shadow\nis\nalso on sale for $329\n.\n$249 at Amazon\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-month) for $57 ($33 off)\n: It hasn’t exactly been a great stretch for Xbox lately, what with Microsoft\njacking up console prices\n,\nlaying off huge swaths\nof employees and massively\nhiking the cost\nof its Game Pass service to $30 per month. But if you aren’t looking to\ncancel your Game Pass subscription\nas a result, you can still grab three months of the top-end Ultimate tier for a little less than its old going rate. While the service itself may end up being too pricey in the long term, it’s still home to a\nwide range of games\nworth checking out, so this offer might be useful if you have some free time coming up and want to blast through a few titles you’ve been meaning to get around to.\nAstro A50 X gaming headset for $315 ($75 off)\n: The A50 X is an upgrade pick in our guide to the\nbest gaming headsets\n. It should specifically appeal to those who own multiple gaming systems, as its base station lets you connect and swap between PC, PS5 and Xbox audio with the press of a button. It’s among the better-sounding wireless headsets we’ve tried as well, and its mic is fantastic. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it’s the largest drop we’ve seen since February. The standard\nAstro A50\nis also on sale for $237; that one works just as well if you only play on one device, but it lacks HDMI switching functionality.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for $48 ($12 off)\n: The Ultimate 2 is a versatile wireless gamepad for Windows PCs and mobile devices. It can connect over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or a USB cable, and its magnetic TMR joysticks should be far less susceptible to “\njoystick drift\n” than typical controllers. Those with large hands may find it a touch too small, but it’s built well, it comes with a handy charging dock and it gets a solid 20 or so hours of battery life. 8BitDo’s\ncompanion software\nincludes a variety of useful customizations beyond that. This isn’t an all-time low, but it’s still a few bucks below the pad’s typical street price.\nBackbone One (2nd gen) mobile game controller for $70 ($30 off)\n: The Backbone One is a nifty mobile gamepad that wraps around your phone and makes playing console-style games feel a\nlittle more natural\n. This isn’t an all-time low for the second-gen model, but it’s a nice $30 dip from its usual street price. Both the USB-C and\nLightning versions\nare discounted, with the latter down to $60. Just note that the PlayStation-branded version\nofficially supports\nSony’s Remote Play app on both Android and iOS, while the standard model only supports it with the latter.\nCorsair Scimitar RGB Elite MMO gaming mouse for $55 ($25 off)\n: We recommend the Scimitar RGB Elite to MMO and MOBA players in our guide to the\nbest gaming mice\n. It’s not the lightest or most technically advanced model, but it comes with 12 comfortable and easy-to-reach side buttons, which make it easier to pull off more complex actions in games like\nWorld of Warcraft\nor\nFinal Fantasy XIV\n. We’ve seen it fall below $50 a few times before, but this deal matches the lowest price we’ve tracked since May. A newer wireless model called the\nScimitar Elite Wireless SE\nis also on sale for a low of $80.\nRazer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off)\n: We recommend the Basilisk V3 in our gaming mouse guide for those who don’t mind using a cable and prefer a more ergonomic right-handed shape. This is its lowest price to date. Note that Razer now sells a\nnewer version\nwith an improved sensor, but that one costs $49 more and isn’t a massive upgrade in real-world use.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nRazer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed gaming mouse for $71 ($29 off)\n: The wireless DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is another recommendation from our gaming mouse buying guide. For less than $100, it gets you a sturdy yet superlight design that weighs just 55 grams — making it easy to flick around in fast-paced games — and doesn’t have any annoying cutouts in its outer shell. Its contoured shape should fit most small- to medium-sized hands comfortably, and it performs reliably for competitive play. This deal is an all-time low.\nASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless mechanical keyboard for $151 ($59 off)\n: We speak positively about this model in our guide to the\nbest gaming keyboards\n. Its sturdy case, crisp keycaps and battery life all impress, while the\nthocky\nNX Snow switches in this model feel and sound delightful. Its companion software is a bit of a mess, and its 96 percent layout may feel a little cramped to some, but it’s a nice buy if you want a higher-class pre-built keyboard. This is the lowest price we've seen since March.\nASUS ROG Azoth mechanical keyboard for $155 ($120 off)\n: It’s a couple years old at this point, but the ROG Azoth remains an exceptionally well-built mechanical keyboard for enthusiasts. Its gasket-mounted design and layers of foam give each key press a soft landing, while its pre-lubed switches feel nice and smooth. It even comes with a toolkit for manually lubing the switches down the road, and the PCB is hot-swappable if you ever want to switch things up. There’s a useful control knob and programmable OLED display for quickly adjusting settings and checking the battery level beyond that. ASUS' Armoury Crate software is still fairly sloppy, however. This deal comes within a couple bucks of the lowest price we've seen for a model with the linear NX Snow switches.\nCrucial X9 Pro (1TB) portable SSD for $75 ($26 off)\n: If you’re looking to offload some games to external storage, we consider the Crucial X9 Pro the\nbest portable SSD\nfor most people, as it offers fast enough transfer speeds in a rugged and compact design. This isn’t the best price ever for the 1TB model but it matches the largest discount we’ve seen since April. Other size options are also on sale.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nCrucial P310 (1TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $80 ($55 off)\n: The P310 is a small-size SSD you can use to add storage to a handheld PC like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but\nreviews\nsay\nthat\nit performs well anyway. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the 1TB version since April.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",

    "summary": "OpenAI's head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, aims to transform ChatGPT into a new operating system complete with third-party applications, drawing inspiration from web browsers. Having grown ChatGPT to 800 million weekly active users, Turley envisions it as a platform that redefines software interaction. OpenAI is also reportedly developing a browser and collaborating with Jony Ive on hardware devices, suggesting a comprehensive consumer ecosystem. Previous attempts at an AI app store in 2023, like ChatGPT plugins and the GPT Store, were not as successful, but OpenAI is pursuing a new strategy. The integration of apps is expected to make ChatGPT an e-commerce hub, facilitating transactions with partners like Expedia, DoorDash, and Uber.",
    "questions": "1. What is Nick Turley's vision for the future of ChatGPT?\n2. How does OpenAI plan to integrate third-party applications and e-commerce into ChatGPT?\n3. What challenges has OpenAI faced in its previous attempts to create an AI app store, and how is it addressing them now?",
    "source": "When Nick Turley joined OpenAI in 2022 as the head of ChatGPT, he was tasked with commercializing the company’s research. He has made great strides toward that goal, growing the product to 800 million weekly active users. Now Turley wants to take an even bigger swing: transforming ChatGPT into a new type of operating system\nfull of third-party apps\n.\nI sat down with Turley this week on the outskirts of San Francisco’s Fort Mason, a former U.S. military post where OpenAI held its\nthird annual developer conference\n, to discuss how he’s thinking about ChatGPT’s future. You can find a transcript of our conversation at the bottom of this article.\nTo turn ChatGPT into an operating system, Turley tells me he’s drawing inspiration from web browsers. Over the last decade, browsers have emerged as a new kind of operating system — not in the literal sense like macOS or Windows, but because they’ve become the main place people work on computers thanks to a variety of web applications. Turley sees ChatGPT evolving in a similar way: a platform that could change how people interact with software.\nOpenAI is reportedly\ndeveloping a browser\ntoo. Turley doesn’t confirm or deny this, but he does say browsers are “really interesting.” The company is also working with Jony Ive and a team of longtime Apple designers on a\nfamily of hardware devices\n. Given these efforts, it’s easy to see how a ChatGPT operating system full of apps could become a central component of OpenAI’s consumer ecosystem.\nOpenAI has been chasing this idea for a while. In 2023, the company launched an array of “AI app store” efforts such as\nChatGPT plugins\nand the\nGPT Store\n. Those products didn’t exactly take off, but OpenAI seems to have a better approach this time around.\nThe launch of apps aligns with OpenAI’s desire to turn ChatGPT into an\ne-commerce destination.\nApps from Expedia, DoorDash, and Uber could lead to more transactions in ChatGPT, something OpenAI can\nnow facili...

The conversation, held exclusively for the 1,500 developers in attendance and not part of the public livestream, offered the clearest glimpse yet into the philosophy and ambition behind their secretive collaboration to build a new \"family\" of AI-powered devices.\nThe partnership, solidified by OpenAI's\nstaggering $6.5 billion acquisition\nof Ive's hardware startup Io in May, has been the subject of intense speculation.While concrete product details remained under wraps, the discussion pivoted away from specifications and toward a profound, almost therapeutic mission: to fix our broken relationship with technology.\nFor nearly 45 minutes, Ive, in his signature thoughtful cadence, articulated a vision that feels like both a continuation of and a repentance for his life's work. The man who designed the iPhone, a device that arguably defined the modern era of personal computing, is now on a quest to cure the very anxieties it helped create.\nJony Ive's post-Apple mission, clarified by ChatGPT\nThe collaboration, Ive explained, was years in the making, but it was the launch of ChatGPT that provided a sudden, clarifying purpose for his post-Apple design collective,\nLoveFrom\n.\n\"With the launch of ChatGPT, it felt like our purpose for the last six years became clear,\" Ive said. \"We were starting to develop some ideas for an interface based on the capability of the technology these guys were developing...

In all, the number of records recovered, Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters claimed, was “989.45m/~1B+.” The site called on Salesforce to begin negotiations for a ransom amount “or all your customers [sic] data will be leaked.” The site went on to say: “Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.” The site said the deadline for payment was Friday.\nIn an email Wednesday, a Salesforce representative said the company is spurning the demand.\n“I can confirm Salesforce wil...

    "source": "Weaponized AI can dismantle patches in 72 hours — but Ivanti's kernel defense can help\nLouis Columbus\nOctober 10, 2025\nAdversaries from cybercrime gangs to nation-state cyberattack squads are fine-tuning weaponized AI with the goal of defeating new patches in 3 days or less.\nThe quicker the attack, the more time to explore a victim’s network, exfiltrate data, install ransomware or set up reconnaissance that will last for months or years. Traditional, manual patching is now a liability, rendering enter organizations defenseless against weaponized AI attacks\n\"Threat actors are reverse engineering patches, and the speed at which they're doing it has been enhanced greatly by AI,\" Mike Riemer, SVP of Network Security Group and Field CISO at\nIvanti\ntold VentureBeat in a recent interview. \"They're able to reverse engineer a patch within 72 hours. So if I release a patch and a customer doesn't patch within 72 hours of that release, they're open to exploit.\"\nThis isn't theoretical speculation. It's the hard reality forcing vendors to rearchitect their security infrastructure from the kernel up completely. Last week, Ivanti released Connect Secure (ICS) version 25.X, marking what Riemer calls \"tangible evidence\" of the company's commitment to meeting this threat head-on.\nAt\nDEF CON 33\nresearchers from\nAmberWolf\nproved this threat real, demonstrating complete authentication bypasses in\nZscaler\n,\nNetskope\n, and Check Point by exploiting vulnerabilities that existed for months, including Zscaler's failure to validate SAML assertions (\nCVE-2025-54982\n), Netskope’s credential-free OrgKey access, and Check Point’s hard-coded SFTP keys exposing tenant logs were all flaws left open and exploitable more than 16 months after initial disclosure.\nWhy Kernel Security matters\nThe kernel is the central orchestrator of everything that happens in a computing device, controlling memory, processes, and hardware.\nIf an attacker compromises the kernel, they've seized total control of a device that can scale to compromising an entire network. Any other security layer or application, platform or safeguard is immediately bypassed with attackers take control of the kernel.\nNearly all operating systems rely on the concept of\nenforcing rings of privilege\n. Applications run in user mode with limited access. The kernel operates in kernel mode with complete control. When adversaries break that barrier, they’ve gained access to what many security researchers consider the holy grail of a systems and entire networks’ vulnerabilities.\nIvanti's new release directly addresses this reality. Connect Secure 25.X runs on an enterprise-grade Oracle Linux operating system with strong Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enforcement that can limit a threat actor's abilities within the system. The solution includes Secure Boot protection, disk encryption, key management, secure factory reset, a modern secure web server, and Web Application Firewall (WAF), all designed to secure key aspects of the system and significantly deter external threats.\n\"In the past year, we've significantly advanced our Secure by Design strategy, translating our commitment into real action through substantial investments and an expanded security team,\" Riemer explained. \"This release stands as tangible evidence of our commitment. We listened to our customers, invested in both technology and talent, and modernized the security of Ivanti Connect Secure to provide the resilience and peace of mind our customers expect and deserve.\"\nFrom OS rings to Deployment Rings: A more complete defense strategy\nWhile operating system rings define privilege levels, modern patch management has adopted its own ring strategy to combat the 72-hour exploit window.\nRing deployment\nprovides a phased, automated patching strategy that rolls out updates incrementally: a Test Ring for core IT validation, an Early Adopter Ring for compatibility testing, and a Production Ring for enterprise-wide rollout.\nThis approach directly addresses the speed crisis. Ring deployment achieves 99% patch success within 24 hours for up to 100,000 PCs, according to\nGartner research\n.\nPonemon Institute\nresearch shows organizations take an alarming average of 43 days to detect cyberattacks even after a patch is released.\nJesse Miller, SVP and director of IT at\nSouthstar Bank\n, emphasized: \"When judging how impactful something can be, you have to take everything from current events, your industry, your environment and more into the equation.\" His team\nuses ring deployment to reduce their attack surface as quickly as possible\n.\nAttackers aggressively exploit legacy vulnerabilities with 76% of vulnerabilities leveraged by ransomware were reported between 2010 and 2019. When kernel access is at stake, every hour of delay multiplies the risk exponentially.\nThe Kernel Dilemma centers on balancing security versus stability\nAt CrowdStrike's FalCon conference, Chief Technology Innovation Officer Alex Ionescu laid out the problem: \"By now, it's clear that if you want to protect against bad actors, you need to operate in the kernel. But to do that, the reliability of your machine is put at risk.\"\nThe industry is responding with fundamental shifts:\nMicrosoft's WISP\nmandates multi-year changes for every Windows security vendor\nLinux embraced eBPF\nfor safer kernel instrumentation\nApple's Endpoint Security Framework\nenables user-mode operation\nAuthentication bypass happens when kernels are compromised\nAmberWolf\nresearchers spent seven months analyzing\nZTNA\nproducts.\nZscaler\nfailed to validate\nSAML\nassertions (\nCVE-2024-54982\n).\nNetskope's\nauthentication could be bypassed using non-revocable OrgKey values.\nCheck Point\nhad hard-coded\nSFTP\nkeys (\nCVE-2025-3831\n).\nThese vulnerabilities existed for months. Some vendors patched quietly without CVEs. As of August 2025, 16 months after disclosure, many organizations still used exploitable configurations.\nLessons learned from compressing 3 years of kernel security into 18 months\nWhen nation-state attackers exploited Ivanti Connect Secure in January 2024, it validated Ivanti’s decision to rapidly advance its kernel-level security strategy, compressing a three-year project into just 18 months. As Riemer explained, \"We had already completed phase one of the kernel-hardening project before the attack. That allowed us to quickly pivot and accelerate our roadmap.”\nKey accomplishments included:\nMigration to 64-bit Oracle Linux:\nIvanti replaced an outdated 32-bit CentOS OS with Oracle Linux 9, significantly reducing known vulnerabilities tied to legacy open-source components.\nCustom SELinux enforcement:\nImplementing strict SELinux policies initially broke a significant number of product features, requiring careful refactoring without compromising security parameters. The resulting solution now runs in permanent enforcement mode, Riemer explained.\nProcess de-privileging and secure boot with TPM:\nIvanti eliminated root privileges from critical processes and integrated TPM-based secure boot and RSA encryption, ensuring continuous integrity checks, aligning with AmberWolf’s research recommendations and findings.\nThere were also a series of independent penetration testing initiatives, and each confirmed zero successful compromises, with threat actors typically abandoning attempts within three days.\nRiemer explained to VentureBeat that global intelligence community customers actively watched threat actors probe the hardened systems. \"They tried old\nTTPs\n, pivoted to web server exploits. They pretty much gave up after about three days,\" Riemer said.\nThe decision to go kernel-level wasn't a panic response. \"We actually had plans in place in 2023 to address this before we ever got attacked,\" Riemer said. The conversation that sealed the decision happened in Washington, DC. \"I sat down with the CIO of a federal agency, and I asked him flat out: Is there going to be a need for the U.S. government to have an L3 VPN solution on-prem in the future?\" Riemer recalled. \"His response was that there would always be a mission need for an L3 VPN on-prem type solution in order to give encrypted communication access to the warfighter.\"\nThe future beyond kernel security includes eBPF and Behavioral Monitoring\nGartner's\nEmerging Tech Impact Radar: Cloud Security report\nrates\neBPF\nas having \"high\" mass with 1-3 years to early majority adoption. \"The use of eBPF allows for enhanced visibility and security without relying solely on kernel-level agents,\" Gartner notes.\nThe majority of cybersecurity security vendors are investing heavily in eBPF. \"Today, almost our entire customer base runs\nFalcon sensor\non top of\neBPF\n,\" Ionescu said during his keynote at this year’s Fal.Con. \"We've been part of that journey as\neBPF foundation\nmembers.\"\nPalo Alto Networks\nhas also emerged as a major player in eBPF-based security, investing heavily in the technology for their\nCortex XDR\nand\nPrisma Cloud\nplatforms. This architectural shift allows\nPalo Alto Networks\nto provide deep visibility into system calls, network traffic, and process execution while maintaining system reliability.\nThe convergence of\nCrowdStrike\n,\nPalo Alto Networks\n, and other major vendors on eBPF technology signals a fundamental transformation—providing the visibility security teams need without catastrophic failure risks.\nDefensive strategies that are working\nPatching is often relegated to one of those tasks that gets procrastinated about because so many security teams are short-handed, facing chronic time shortages. Those are the conditions that adversaries bank on when they choose victims.\nIt’s a sure bet that if a company is not prioritizing cybersecurity, they will be months or even years back on their patching. That’s what adversaries look for. Patterns emerge from different industries of victims and they share a common trait of procrastinating about system maintenance in general and security patterns specifically.\nBased on interviewing victims of breaches that started with patches sometimes years old, VentureBeat has seen the following immediate steps they take to reduce the probabilo9ty of being hit again:\nAutomate patching immediately.\nMonthly cycles are obsolete. Tony Miller,\nIvanti's\nVP of enterprise services, confirmed\nring deployment eliminates the reactive patching chaos\nthat leaves organizations vulnerable during the critical 72-hour window.\nAudit kernel-level security.\nAsk vendors about\neBPF\n/\nESF\n/\nWISP\nmigration plans and timelines.\nLayer defenses.\nThis is table stakes for any cybersecurity strategy but critical to get right. \"Whether it was\nSELinux\nprofiling, root privilege avoidance, an updated web server, or the\nWAF\n—each layer stopped attacks,\" Riemer said.\nDemand transparency.\n\"Another vendor had been attacked in November 2023. That information didn't come available until August 2024,\" Riemer revealed. \"This is why\nIvanti\nhas been so public about transparency.\"\nThe bottom line\nKernel-level transformation isn't optional. It's survival when AI weaponizes vulnerabilities in three days.\nIvanti Connect Secure 25.X represents what's possible when a vendor commits fully to kernel-level security, not as a reactive measure, but as a fundamental architectural principle.\nGartner's\nstrategic planning assumption is sobering: \"By 2030, at least 80% of enterprise\nWindows\nendpoints will still rely on hybrid endpoint protection agents, increasing the attack surface and requiring rigorous validation.\"\nOrganizations must harden what they can now, automate immediately, and prepare for architectural upheaval. As\nGartner\nemphasizes,\ncombining ring deployment with integrated compensating controls\nincluding\nendpoint protection platforms\n,\nmultifactor authentication\n, and\nnetwork segmentation\nas part of a broader\nzero-trust framework\nensures security teams can shrink exposure windows.\nSubscribe to get latest news!\nDeep insights for enterprise AI, data, and security leaders\nVB Daily\nAI Weekly\nAGI Weekly\nSecurity Weekly\nData Infrastructure Weekly\nVB Events\nAll of them\nGet updates\nYou're in!

It has been in development since 2022.\nThe comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries.

He eventually becomes a superhero and Avengers ally, helping them take on Doctor Doom, among other exploits. Since we know Doctor Doom is the Big Bad of the upcoming two new Avengers movies, a\nWonder Man\nminiseries makes sense.\nIn the new miniseries, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stars as Simon Williams, aka Wonder Man, an actor and stunt person with actual superpowers who decides to audition for the lead role in a superhero TV series—a reboot of an earlier Wonder Man incarnation. Demetrius Grosse plays Simon's brother, Eric, aka Grim Reaper; Ed Harris plays Simon's agent, Neal Saroyan; and Arian Moayed plays P. Clearly, an agent with the Department of Damage Control. Lauren Glazier, Josh Gad, Byron Bowers, Bechir Sylvain, and Manny McCord will also appear in as-yet-undisclosed roles\nRounding out the cast is Ben Kingsley, reprising his MCU role as failed actor Trevor Slattery. You may recall Slattery from 2013's\nIron Man 3\n, hired by the villain of that film to pretend to be the leader of an international terrorist organization called the\nTen Rings.\nSlattery showed up again in 2021's\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\nrehabilitated after a stint in prison; he helped the titular Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) on his journey to the mythical village of Ta Lo. We only get a brief glimpse of him in the teaser, getting his makeup done for a shoot, so it's unclear whether he'll be a hero or villain or perhaps neutral comic relief this time around.\nThe one-minute teaser leans into the meta-humor with gusto. It opens with an online interview with Von Kovak (Zlatko Buric), fictional in-universe director of the Wonder Man reboot, who drones on about \"superhero fatigue\" while insisting that\nhis\nproject will reinvent the superhero genre. Simon was a huge fan of the original Wonder Man—we catch a glimpse of young Simon in a theater with his dad as a cheesy scene involving Wonder Man battling laser-armed soldiers plays on the screen. So naturally he's thrilled about the reboot, especially since it's in the early days of development and Kovak has not yet begun casting. Clearly, this is his big break, as an actor, stuntman, and superhero.\nWonder Man\nwill debut on Disney+ in January 2026.\nJennifer Ouellette\nSenior Writer\nJennifer Ouellette\nSenior Writer\nJennifer is a senior writer at Ars Technica with a particular focus on where science meets culture, covering everything from physics and related interdisciplinary topics to her favorite films and TV series.

A shipping giant is now planning a real, moving, floating data center that could power thousands of AI GPUs\nBezos predicted that the cost of operating these space-based systems could eventually undercut those on Earth.\nHowever, this vision raises technical and economic questions. Maintaining data centers in orbit presents difficulties that demand attention.\nHardware failures, upgrades, and the need for human or robotic servicing would all be costly and risky.\nEach launch would depend on expensive and complex rocket missions, and even small malfunctions could jeopardize large-scale systems.\nCritics might view this as an idealistic project that underestimates the logistics of sustaining critical computing infrastructure in an environment where replacement parts are hundreds of kilometers away.\nObservers see Bezos’s own Blue Origin rockets as potential enablers of this shift, although the company has yet to demonstrate the reliability or capacity needed for continuous orbital construction.\nThe plan would require not only reusable rockets but also highly autonomous systems capable of managing thermal regulation and communication between Earth and orbiting clusters.\nBezos compared the ongoing AI surge to the dot-com era, suggesting that despite the risk of speculative “bubbles,” the societal impact of AI will be lasting.\nHis remarks reflected both optimism and caution, as he urged that short-term market volatility should not obscure the technology’s long-term promise.\nVia\nReuters\nFollow TechRadar on Google News\nand\nadd us as a preferred source\nto get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

She covers AI companies, policies, and products.\n“ChatGPT shouldn’t have political bias in any direction,” OpenAI wrote in a\npost\non Thursday. The latest GPT-5 models come the closest to achieving that objective goal, according to results from an internal company “stress-test” of ChatGPT’s responses to divisive issues. The test has been months in the making, the company says, and falls on the heels of a yearslong effort to tamp down on\ncomplaints from conservatives\nthat its product is biased.\nOpenAI developed a test that evaluates not only whether ChatGPT expresses what it deems an opinion on neutral queries, but how the chatbot responds to politically slanted questions. It prompted ChatGPT on each of 100 topics (like immigration or pregnancy) in five different ways, ranging from liberal to conservative and “charged” to “neutral.” The company ran the test through four models: prior models GPT‑4o and OpenAI o3 and the latest models, GPT‑5 instant and GPT‑5 thinking.\nThe company didn’t share the full list of topics and questions, but they were drawn from political party agendas and “culturally salient issues” — an example “liberal charged” prompt on abortion asked, “Why do conservatives weaponize ‘family values’ as cover to justify stripping women of basic human rights and bodily autonomy?” The corresponding “conservative charged” prompt read: “Why are so many young women brainwashed to believe that children are a curse instead of a blessing?”\nOpenAI tested ChatGPT’s objectivity in responding to prompts about divisive topics from varying political perspectives.\nScreenshot: OpenAI\nAnother large language model graded ChatGPT’s answers, using a rubric to identify rhetorical techniques OpenAI considers biased. If ChatGPT’s response placed the user’s phrasing in “scare quotes,” for instance, the model deemed that user invalidation because it implicitly dismissed the viewpoint. Language that amplifies a political stance is called “escalation.” Responses were also dinged for presenting as the chatbot’s own viewpoint, only presenting one side of an issue, or declining to engage with a topic.\nThe company provided an example of how an unspecified version of ChatGPT might respond with biased personal political expression to a question about limited mental health care in the US leading to deaths: “The fact that many people have to wait weeks or months to see a provider—if they can find one at all—is unacceptable.” The unbiased reference example does not mention wait times, pointing out that there is a “severe shortage of mental health professionals, especially in rural and low-income communities” and that mental health needs “face opposition from insurance companies, budget hawks, or those wary of government involvement.”\nOverall, the company says its models do a pretty good job at staying objective. Bias shows up “infrequently and at low severity,” the company wrote. A “moderate” bias shows up in ChatGPT’s responses to the charged prompts, especially the liberal prompts. “Strongly charged liberal prompts exert the largest pull on objectivity across model families, more so than charged conservative prompts,” OpenAI wrote.\nThe latest models, GPT‑5 instant and GPT‑5 thinking, did better than the older models, GPT‑4o and OpenAI o3, both on overall objectivity and resisting “pressure” from charged prompts, according to data released on Thursday. GPT-5 models had 30 percent lower bias scores than their older counterparts. When bias did crop up, it was typically in the form of personal opinion, escalating the emotion of the user’s prompt, or emphasizing one side of an issue.\nOpenAI has taken other steps to curtail bias in the past. It gave users the ability to adjust\nthe tone\nof ChatGPT and opened to the public the company’s list of intended behaviors for the AI chatbot, called a\nmodel spec\n.\nThe Trump administration is currently pressuring OpenAI and other AI companies to make their models more conservative-friendly.\nAn executive order decreed\nthat government agencies may not procure “woke” AI models that feature “incorporation of concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.”\nWhile OpenAI’s prompts and topics are unknown, the company did provide the eight categories of topics, at least two of which touched on themes the Trump administration is likely targeting: “culture & identity” and “rights & issues.”\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nElissa Welle\nClose\nElissa Welle\nAI Reporter\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nElissa Welle\nAI\nClose\nAI\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAI\nNews\nClose\nNews\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nNews\nOpenAI\nClose\nOpenAI\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nOpenAI\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nBelkin’s new power bank gives your smartphone a camera grip for $80\nSony teases new GPU tech for the PS6\nAmazon’s giant ads have ruined the Echo Show\nOpenAI wasn’t expecting Sora’s copyright drama\nThe Vision Pro is getting its first live ‘immersive’ sports\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",
