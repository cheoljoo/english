The\nUnited States countered\nin August, when acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reportedly\nsuggested a US reactor\nwould be operational on the Moon by 2030.\nWhile it might feel like a sudden sprint, this isn’t exactly breaking news.

    "source": "Chowdeck\n, a Lagos-based food delivery startup that has stayed profitable in a\nnotoriously tough and low-margin market\n, has raised $9 million in Series A funding to launch a quick commerce strategy and expand into more cities in Nigeria and Ghana.\nThe equity round was led by Novastar Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator, AAIC Investment, Rebel Fund, GFR Fund, Kaleo, HoaQ, and others. The investors are betting on the team’s ability to pair local market expertise with execution and turn a notoriously difficult sector into a profitable super app for food, groceries and essentials.\n“We’re thrilled about this round as it brings us closer to our vision of becoming Africa’s number one super app,” CEO and co-founder\nFemi Aluko\nsaid. “This funding will supercharge our growth plans, enabling us to expand into more cities, reduce delivery times, scale our grocery footprint, and attract the best talent to drive innovation and customer satisfaction.”\nFounded in October 2021 by Aluko,\nOlumide Ojo\n, and\nLanre Yusuf\n, Chowdeck now operates in 11 cities across Nigeria and Ghana, serving 1.5 million customers with a network of more than 20,000 riders. Its logistics system averages 30 minutes per order, and in dense areas, more than half of deliveries arrive by bicycle.\nWhile prominent players have exited or scaled back their African operations, Chowdeck has leaned into the complexity of local markets—delivering local meals, an operationally harder challenge—to build trust with customers.\nIn 2024, the value of meals delivered through Chowdeck grew more than sixfold from the previous year. This year, the company says it passed its 2024 total before July.\nThe new funding will help Chowdeck roll out quick commerce, ultra-fast delivery backed by a network of dark stores and hyperlocal logistics hubs. The company plans to open 40 dark stores by the end of this year and 500 by the end of 2026, with two to three new stores launching each week. Chowdeck\nraised a $2.5 million\nseed round last year.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

In Europe,\nGorillas and Getir\nburned through hundreds of millions of dollars before retreating or consolidating. In India, platforms like\nBlinkit\n,\nZepto\nand\nSwiggy\nhave had varying levels of success with the model when it comes to profitability.\nChowdeck has been profitable since before this raise and Aluko says the company doesn’t enter cities or verticals without planning to break even within a couple of weeks.\nFor instance, the food delivery platform\nentered neighbouring Ghana this May\n. Within three months,\nit was handling 1,000 daily orders\nwithout paid advertising, which, according to Aluko, came from pent-up demand for a service that delivers local favorites alongside international cuisines. The company aims to quintuple that volume to 5,000 daily orders by the end of September 2025.\nAluko says Chowdeck plans to apply the same playbook to dark stores, which will complement its restaurant and grocery delivery operations.\nAnother vertical complementing these operations will be software. This June,\nthe YC-backed startup acquired Mira\n, a point-of-sale provider for African food and hospitality businesses. Mira’s tools manage inventory and orders in real time; now, it will help Chowdeck optimize its operations, positioning the company as a vertical SaaS-plus-logistics provider for restaurants.\nChowdeck’s raise is a win for local players in the sector,\nafter Jumia’s exit\nleft market share to foreign brands such as Glovo, Bolt Food, and Yango. Yet,\nsome of these companies\nhave also withdrawn\nfrom certain markets\n, including Nigeria and Ghana, which Chowdeck is now targeting aggressively.\nSuper apps such as Gozem, YC-backed\nYassir\n, and\nMNT-Halan\nare other local companies offering food delivery services in other African markets.\n“The market is still very early,” Aluko said. “Customer behavior is shifting online for the first time. A whole generation is growing up ordering food without ever having walked into some of the restaurants or markets on our platform.”\nFor lead investor Novastar Ventures, the bet is on execution and local insight. “Chowdeck is building the future of logistics for African cities,” said partner Brian Waswani Odhiambo. “With deep local insight, a sustainability-first approach, and impressive execution, it is redefining last-mile delivery on the continent.”\nNigeria’s YC-backed Chowdeck hopes to scale food delivery, a notoriously tough market, with $2.5M funding\nTopics\nAfrica\n,\nChowdeck\n,\nfood apps\n,\nfood delivery\n,\nnigeria food delivery\n,\nStartups\nTage Kene-Okafor\nReporter, Africa\nTage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

Now, in the digital world, heists look starkly different and\ncybersecurity\nthreats are constant, with banks like NatWest facing a “continuous arms race” with around 100 million cyber-attacks every month. What used to be gangs of robbers digging tunnels and smuggling deposit boxes full of cash are now groups of hackers sending phishing emails and holding some of the most notable companies to ransom for hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThis transition from physical to digital theft is evident. No longer confined to vaults and getaway cars, today's high-stake heists are executed remotely, by online threat actors. These modern-day criminals operate across borders, targeting vulnerabilities in systems and human behavior to extract data and money. The sheer volume and relentless nature of these digital assaults, as exemplified by financial institutions battling millions of cyber-attacks monthly, highlight a new era of crime.\nAndy Syrewicze\nSocial Links Navigation\nSecurity Evangelist at Hornetsecurity.\nThe growing problem of cyber-attacks\nCyber-attacks are a growing problem, amongst a growing number of sectors, and confronting this escalating issue is vital. It’s not just banks that are facing the constant threat of cyber-attacks; cyber threats are growing at an exponential rate, while becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted.\nYou may like\nWhy burnout is one of the biggest threats to your security\nThe Human Firewall: even with AI, humans are still the last line of defense in cybersecurity\nSMBs remain easy pickings for cybercriminals - here’s why\nData breaches have hit a myriad of industries: from luxury brands like Dior and supermarkets like M&S, to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and UK government organization Legal Aid.\nThe dangers to personal data are being felt across all sectors, at all digital touchpoints. Amid this battleground of immediate cyber threats comes a growing demand for robust\nsecurity\nsolutions that address company concerns.\nFrom advanced\nantivirus\ntechnologies to endpoint\nbackup software\n, AI-powered security is evolving rapidly to stay ahead of such attacks - and it’s essential that companies invest in these defenses in order to stay more than one step ahead.\nEvolution of technology\nAs technology evolves at a rapid pace, companies must keep up with advancements made by cyber-attackers. As businesses of all sizes continue to embrace digital transformation, the need to strengthen their cybersecurity grows increasingly critical.\nAre you a pro?

This Code of Practice and governance framework package guides boards and directors in managing digital risks and safeguarding their businesses and organizations from cyberattacks.\nThe framework encourages companies to take four employee-focused actions: foster a cybersecurity culture; ensure clear policies support a positive cybersecurity culture; improve their own cyber literacy through training; and use suitable metrics to verify the organization has an effective cybersecurity training, education, and awareness program.\nThe report is a clear reminder that the human\nfirewall\n, that is, the employees who encounter an attack and respond, is just as important as technological defenses.\nMore than a simple fix, a culture shift is needed\nIt’s not enough to roll out generic training. The reality is that in today’s world, one wrong click can bring a business to a complete halt. According to the latest insights, the approximate amount of ransoms paid globally in 2024 reached $813.55 million.\nWhen requested to pay a ransom, companies know that refusing to do so runs the risk of their customers’ personal information being leaked publicly, which would additionally require them to pay the associated financial penalties and legal payouts, not to mention reputational damage.\nAddressing the threat of cyber-attacks must be embedded in a company’s culture, given the fact that if threat actors are successful, the impact of their actions would be felt not only company-wide but also by the ecosystem within which the organization operates.\nLeadership and security\nOrganizations can bolster their security by cultivating strong leadership, providing tailored training, and building a proactive security culture to create a ‘human firewall’ of colleagues armed with know-how.\nEmployees\nof all skillsets and seniorities should undergo comprehensive and ongoing cyber awareness training, whatever their role and seniority, to drive the defenses forward and cultivate a mindful culture.\nWhen employees are provided with the knowledge and tools to maintain awareness of the dangers their company is facing, they can be the most effective method to keep the business secure.\nBuilding a mindful culture\nBuilding a mindful culture can be complemented by a Zero Trust approach, which creates a robust defense against evolving cyber threats. This strategic approach mandates rigorous verification for all access requests, irrespective of their origin or the user's location within the network, thereby yielding exceptionally strong results that effectively eliminate a significant portion of potential threats.\nFor example, when an employee receives an email requesting sensitive information or a link to a suspicious\nwebsite\n, they should be trained to recognize it as a potential phishing attempt right away, verify the sender's identity, and report the email to the IT department for further investigation.\nThis proactive stance, ingrained through a Zero Trust philosophy and continuous education, significantly reduces the likelihood of successful breaches. It’s better safe than sorry, and in the realm of cybersecurity, this means being diligent about taking the extra steps to fortify an organization's digital defenses.\nDon't stop at basic protections\nDon't stop at basic protections, make ongoing training a priority. Defenses can’t stop at antivirus technology and\nendpoint protection\n, and training isn’t a one-time solution. While these are the necessities, they are simply not enough for the twenty-first century heist as businesses continue to battle millions of cyber-attacks each month.\nAs threats advance or teams become complacent, ongoing phishing simulations, tests and education are key in maintaining a robust human firewall. Companies must invest in technology and ongoing training to equip employees across all roles and levels with the skills and awareness to stay alert. A company’s greatest weapon can be its workforce, if leveraged.\nCybersecurity needs tech, but it's nothing without people who are well trained to understand the latest attack methods and protect against the digital transition's inherent risks.\nWe list the best ransomware protection\n.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

But we’re a few months into the console’s lifecycle now and there are a variety of Switch 2-only games that are worth your cash, as well as a bunch of original Switch games that have received improvements for the new console And there’s also a robust selection of third-party games that have been on other consoles for a while, but not available on the Switch.\nBetween all those, there are plenty of good games for the Switch 2 — and if you don’t have an original Switch, there’s even more out there. You can see\nour list of our favorite Switch games here\n, but this list will focus on Switch 2 exclusives, original Switch games that have been improved for the new hardware and the best-performing, third-party titles worth your time. And keep an eye on this list, as there should be a lot more Switch 2 exclusives coming this fall that we're excited to try, including eagerly-awaited titles like\nMetroid Prime 4\n.\nQuick Overview\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nMario Kart World\nMore options\n$79 at Amazon\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nMore options\n$67 at Amazon\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition\nMore options\n$69 at Amazon\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition\nMore options\n$79 at Amazon\nFast Fusion\n$15 at GameStop\nSee 4 more\nBest Nintendo Switch 2 games for 2025\nNintendo\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nMario Kart World\nMario Kart World\nisn’t quite the\nreinvention\nof the massively popular franchise that I thought it might be based on Nintendo’s extensive preview of the game. No matter. Mario Kart is a proven formula, and Nintendo has done more than enough to make\nMKW\nthe kind of game that millions of people will play over the next decade or so. There are a ton of cleverly-designed new tracks that you can pick up and play immediately — but the more time you put into them, the more shortcuts and secrets you’ll find to help master them. There’s a truckload of Nintendo characters to pilot your kart or bike, from the heavy hitters to bizarre but amusing choices like a Piranha plant. And there are beefed-up multiplayer and sharing features powered by GameChat on the Switch 2.\nBut while\nMario Kart World\nwill feel familiar to the millions who played\nMario Kart 8\n, it also introduces a few noteworthy new features. One is that the majority of courses don’t have you doing three laps around a track — instead, you’re driving from point A to point B, with every track being set in a part of a larger world (hence the name). And there’s an open-world mode where you’re not in a race. You can cruise from one side of the map to the other, looking for little bonus challenges, unlocking more outfits for your characters and finding other collectibles. There are hundreds of P-Switch challenges and dozens of Peach medallions and question mark boxes you can track down. The fact that you can’t cruise around free roam in multiplayer mode is a major bummer, and the world itself feels somewhat deserted as a result, but there’s still a ton to do here.\nThe open-world nature of the game also enables a new race type: Knockout mode. This is probably my favorite part — it’s an ongoing race across six courses with five checkpoints along the way. At each checkpoint, you have to be higher than a certain ranking or you’ll be eliminated. Being in the top 20 out of 24 total racers at the first checkpoint isn’t so tough, but obviously the challenge grows as the field is trimmed. Knockout mode is a great combo of a more traditional Grand Prix style race with a longer, world-crossing sprint to the finish. While I wish Nintendo took just a few more risks with\nMario Kart World,\nit’s the kind of game anyone can pick up and have a blast with.\n— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor\n$79 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$80 at Macy's\n$80 at Target\nNintendo\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nNintendo hasn’t made a 3D Donkey Kong platformer since 1999, but\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nis\nmore than worth the wait\n. I’d argue that it’s the first must-buy title for the Switch 2 and the most compelling reason to buy Nintendo’s latest console as soon as you can. It takes a delightful gaming mechanic (smashing nearly everything you can get your fists on) and builds a huge variety of engaging experiences around it. At first, I was worried I’d get tired of all the smashing, but the wide variety of different worlds and challenges keep things continuously fresh. The Bananza powers you pick up throughout the game definitely help with that, too — you can power up DK so his smashes are more potent, or transform into a speedy zebra to dash through obstacles or an ostrich that can float above them.\nThere’s also more story to the game than I expected, centering on DK and the 13-year-old girl Pauline who accompanies him through most of his adventures. She’s a charming sidekick and her love of singing is what helps DK unlock the aforementioned Bananza powers. The game is also absolutely gorgeous and visually stunning, with each world having a completely different vibe from the one that came before it — but they’re all wonderfully rendered. The music rules, too. Pauline’s songs are catchier than they have any right to be, and I had them stuck in my head long after I put the game down.\nDonkey Kong Bananaza\nis, quite simply, Nintendo at its best.\n— N.I.\n$67 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Macy's\n$70 at Target\nNintendo\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition\nAs a launch title for the original Switch,\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nwas a massive critical and commercial success for Nintendo. It shook up the formula the series had largely stuck to for decades, gave players a massive version of Hyrule to explore and an endless variety of ways to tackle the game’s challenges. But even when it came out in 2017, it was clear that\nBreath of the Wild\nwas pushing the Switch’s modest hardware to the limit. Framerates could often drop below 30, the game maxed out at 1080p resolution and load times were rather long.\nFor\nBreath of the Wild\naficionados and new players alike, the Switch 2 edition of this classic is definitely worth your time. The framerate is essentially locked at 60fps and that makes a massive difference in how fluid the game feels. It can also run in up to 4K resolution when the Switch 2 is docked. And while the game’s art style is such that extreme fidelity isn’t always obvious, there’s no doubt it looks better overall. Faster load times when jumping in and out of shrines is also a major quality of life upgrade.\nOne of the coolest things about\nBreath of the Wild\nfor the Switch 2 is the companion Zelda Notes tool. It’s part of the Switch smartphone app and lets you do things like turn on navigation to find shrines and other landmarks around Hyrule, as well as fun tidbits like voice memories for various locations and daily bonuses like free meals or weapon durability restores. The Switch 2 edition of\nBreath of the Wild\nis a $10 upgrade if you own the base game, but it’s free for anyone who subscribes to the $50 / year Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Park service.\n— N.I.\n$69 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Target\n$90 at Macy's\nNintendo\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition\nWith\nTears of the Kingdom\n, Nintendo managed to follow up the reinvention of the Zelda series with a game that added more to discover and more to play with, and it even throws in a mystical LEGO kit. Link soon discovers Ultrahand, which lets you grab and stick objects, batteries, engines, weapons, food (and more) to other objects. It’s the standout addition compared to its predecessor; a creative toolbox of solutions (or foolish endeavors) to solve every puzzle, fight every beast and explore every part of\nTears of the Kingdom.\nThe Switch 2 edition adds the sort of improvements and upgrades that, arguably, warrant paying to upgrade your Switch edition. To start with, I struggled to make the frame rates choke in my current playthrough. On the original Switch, the gorgeous world of Hyrule would often stutter and slow as you transitioned between sky, surface and underground. The game’s framerates would peak at 30fps, while busy moments (or lots of custom building) could knock those rates severely.\nOn the Switch 2,\nToTK\nruns at 60fps, locked. It plays smoothly, pretty much all the time, and it’s a big improvement to what is still a beautiful adventure. The new hardware adds HDR to the graphics. This expanded dynamic range comes into its own in the underground depths sections, the low-light areas a little clearer and easier to navigate. No surprise: loading times are also quicker when fast travelling and loading the game initially.\nThere are also gameplay quality-of-life upgrades, including audio logs you can discover and listen to on the companion smartphone app and the ability to both store and share your items, weapons and ingredients. If your favorite part was crafting spinning laser death machines, et al, with your Ultrahand, the ability to save builds as QR codes and share with friends is a fun addition, if a little limited in utility at the start. You will have to manually scour the internet for creations from people who aren’t on your friends list.\nThat limitation aside, the Switch 2 edition delivers plenty for that $10 upgrade charge – and Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass subscribers get both\nToTK\nand\nBoTW\nupgrades for free.\n— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief\n$79 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$80 at Target\n$80 at Best Buy\nShin'en Multimedia\nFast Fusion\nFast Fusion\nis a sci-fi arcade racer that wears its influences proudly. It loves\nWipeout\nand the 3D\nF-Zero\ngames, and it wants little more than to bring their ideas into modern times. Fortunately, those games ruled, so there are much worse inspirations to rip from.\nThe key to\nFast Fusion\nis right in the title: It is seriously fast, and it commits to that feeling of speed with every choice it makes. Whooshing lines drag from the back of your hard-angled ship, its engine wheezing, the background perpetually blurred. You and your opponents cut through the air like hands out the window of a speeding car. Gloriously, you can jump, sometimes skipping turns entirely, other times launching yourself into a fiery wreck. An\nIkaruga\n-esque mechanic has you quickly match the color of your craft to the many boost pads littered around each course, and there’s a boost meter you can keep topped up by taking the right line through a given section. Do it all right, and you can complete whole races without ever slowing down. Miss a few, and you’re playing a game of resource management at 500 miles per hour.\nThere’s pretty much no continuity between each track: One race you’re dashing through a forest like it’s\nReturn of the Jedi\n; the next you’re dodging tornadoes on a stormy highway. But they are spectacles, and crucially, they give you the space to maintain your speed, with few super-tight turns thrown in your way. When there is an obstacle to dodge — a giant rotating fan, crashing logs — you tend to just whiz by, furthering the sense of walking a tightrope. It all adds up to a racer that, like its spiritual predecessors, keeps you constantly engaged. For $15, it’s a pretty good deal too. Just note that there’s no online multiplayer. —\nJeff Dunn, Senior Reporter\n$15 at GameStop\nNintendo\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nWith\nDK taking center stage in the Switch 2's first AAA platformer\n, that means we're going to have to wait a bit longer for a new mainline Mario game (\nMario Kart World\ndoesn't count). But you know that? That's ok, because\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nis still an all-time great title even among an already star-studded franchise.\nIt has one of the best soundtracks of any Mario game (\nJump Up, Super Star\nanyone?) and some of the wildest mechanics. You want to turn Mario into a T-Rex? Sure, why not? How about a Hammer Bro or a Goomba? You got it — and that's just the start. And with levels that will take you from the city to an edible wonderland, there's no shortage of places to explore. So if somehow you've managed to skip\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nand are looking to play one of the best 3D platformers ever made, picking this up for the Switch 2 is a no-brainer. And did we mention it runs better on Nintendo's latest console, too?\n— Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter\n$42 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$59 at Macy's\n$60 at Target\nNintendo\nPokémon Scarlet & Pokémon Violet\nSome might have issues with its rigid level scaling or certain areas feeling a bit empty, but if\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet\nhad come out on the Switch 2 instead of the original Switch, Nintendo could have completely sidestepped one of the title's biggest issues: lackluster performance. But thanks to a free update pack for Nintendo's latest console, the game runs beautifully. Framerates are higher and more stable, draw distance is farther, monster density has been increased and textures and visuals have been optimized across the board. This is how the game was meant to be experienced all along and with an open world format, three different main storylines and over 100 new Pokémon to encounter,\nScarlet and Violet\nfeels like it's gotten a second life on the Switch 2.\n— S.R.\n$120 at Macy's\nExplore More Buying Options\n$120 at Target\n$127 at Amazon\nIO Interactive\nHitman: World of Assassination\nWorld of Assassination\nis how the\nHitman\nseries packaged together three meaty entries in the death-dealing series, with online limited-run events, celebrities and even an eventual Bond tie-in. Is it the best, smoothest way to play Hitman? No, but while the frame-rate dips when you‘re blending into the crowds at Formula 1, or hiding away in at the fashion show, it’s playable and it looks good. It’s also a good indication of the leap between the two Switch consoles: The original games ran on the Switch, but demanded cloud streaming.\nIO Interactive put so much attention into building compelling sandbox levels, and you’ll really live in stages like Dartmoor as you figure out the most delightful ways to end your target. Also: there are so many disguises.\nIf you thought three games in one is a lot, this is also the Signature Edition, which folds in even more content, levels and missions. There’s a lot to play through and if, like me, you never quite finished the trilogy, this is a portable, convenient way to wrap up Agent 47’s saga. It also gives the studio plenty of time to refine performance on the Switch 2 ahead of its big Bond title,\n007 First Light. — M.S.\n$60 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$60 at Target\n$64 at Macy's\nCD Projekt\nCyberpunk 2077\nCyberpunk 2077\ncertainly isn't the newest game on this list, but the idea of porting this game over to the original Switch and its outdated hardware is so laughable, CD Projekt Red probably didn't even try. But that's what makes seeing it run on the Switch 2 so impressive. Sure, if you do some serious pixel peeping, you might notice where some graphics don't look quite as good as they would on a high-end PC or PS5. But getting the game to run as smoothly as it does on a system that you can bring pretty much anywhere is no small feat. Plus, the Ultimate Edition version of the game includes the Phantom Liberty expansion, which means you'll have well over a hundred hours of sci-fi RPG ruckus to engage in.\n— S.R.\n$69 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Best Buy\nCheck out our entire\nBest Games series\nincluding the\nbest Nintendo Switch games\n, the\nbest PS5 games\n, the\nbest Xbox games\n, the\nbest PC games\nand the\nbest free games\nyou can play today.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",

    "source": "In 2025, the average urban Indian no longer needs to wait very long for much (except at government offices and in traffic): They simply have to order what they need from an app, and it’ll be delivered within minutes. The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes. It seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days. It was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round. The new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago. The startup now has bookings numbering in the ‘four-digits’ every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures. Pronto founder and CEO Anjali Sardana with workers Image Credits: Pronto ‘It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,’ Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round. For investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. ‘We were very impressed by Anjali’s clarity of thought and execution,’ said Anand Chandrasekaran, a partner at General Catalyst, in a prepared statement. ‘The market for at-home services is massive but also very nuanced. We believe that Anjali and the team have the right vision and approach to build a generational company in this space.’",

So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders. Building TD AI Bosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team.
