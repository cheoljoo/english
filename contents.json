The\nUnited States countered\nin August, when acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reportedly\nsuggested a US reactor\nwould be operational on the Moon by 2030.\nWhile it might feel like a sudden sprint, this isn’t exactly breaking news.

    "source": "Chowdeck\n, a Lagos-based food delivery startup that has stayed profitable in a\nnotoriously tough and low-margin market\n, has raised $9 million in Series A funding to launch a quick commerce strategy and expand into more cities in Nigeria and Ghana.\nThe equity round was led by Novastar Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator, AAIC Investment, Rebel Fund, GFR Fund, Kaleo, HoaQ, and others. The investors are betting on the team’s ability to pair local market expertise with execution and turn a notoriously difficult sector into a profitable super app for food, groceries and essentials.\n“We’re thrilled about this round as it brings us closer to our vision of becoming Africa’s number one super app,” CEO and co-founder\nFemi Aluko\nsaid. “This funding will supercharge our growth plans, enabling us to expand into more cities, reduce delivery times, scale our grocery footprint, and attract the best talent to drive innovation and customer satisfaction.”\nFounded in October 2021 by Aluko,\nOlumide Ojo\n, and\nLanre Yusuf\n, Chowdeck now operates in 11 cities across Nigeria and Ghana, serving 1.5 million customers with a network of more than 20,000 riders. Its logistics system averages 30 minutes per order, and in dense areas, more than half of deliveries arrive by bicycle.\nWhile prominent players have exited or scaled back their African operations, Chowdeck has leaned into the complexity of local markets—delivering local meals, an operationally harder challenge—to build trust with customers.\nIn 2024, the value of meals delivered through Chowdeck grew more than sixfold from the previous year. This year, the company says it passed its 2024 total before July.\nThe new funding will help Chowdeck roll out quick commerce, ultra-fast delivery backed by a network of dark stores and hyperlocal logistics hubs. The company plans to open 40 dark stores by the end of this year and 500 by the end of 2026, with two to three new stores launching each week. Chowdeck\nraised a $2.5 million\nseed round last year.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

In Europe,\nGorillas and Getir\nburned through hundreds of millions of dollars before retreating or consolidating. In India, platforms like\nBlinkit\n,\nZepto\nand\nSwiggy\nhave had varying levels of success with the model when it comes to profitability.\nChowdeck has been profitable since before this raise and Aluko says the company doesn’t enter cities or verticals without planning to break even within a couple of weeks.\nFor instance, the food delivery platform\nentered neighbouring Ghana this May\n. Within three months,\nit was handling 1,000 daily orders\nwithout paid advertising, which, according to Aluko, came from pent-up demand for a service that delivers local favorites alongside international cuisines. The company aims to quintuple that volume to 5,000 daily orders by the end of September 2025.\nAluko says Chowdeck plans to apply the same playbook to dark stores, which will complement its restaurant and grocery delivery operations.\nAnother vertical complementing these operations will be software. This June,\nthe YC-backed startup acquired Mira\n, a point-of-sale provider for African food and hospitality businesses. Mira’s tools manage inventory and orders in real time; now, it will help Chowdeck optimize its operations, positioning the company as a vertical SaaS-plus-logistics provider for restaurants.\nChowdeck’s raise is a win for local players in the sector,\nafter Jumia’s exit\nleft market share to foreign brands such as Glovo, Bolt Food, and Yango. Yet,\nsome of these companies\nhave also withdrawn\nfrom certain markets\n, including Nigeria and Ghana, which Chowdeck is now targeting aggressively.\nSuper apps such as Gozem, YC-backed\nYassir\n, and\nMNT-Halan\nare other local companies offering food delivery services in other African markets.\n“The market is still very early,” Aluko said. “Customer behavior is shifting online for the first time. A whole generation is growing up ordering food without ever having walked into some of the restaurants or markets on our platform.”\nFor lead investor Novastar Ventures, the bet is on execution and local insight. “Chowdeck is building the future of logistics for African cities,” said partner Brian Waswani Odhiambo. “With deep local insight, a sustainability-first approach, and impressive execution, it is redefining last-mile delivery on the continent.”\nNigeria’s YC-backed Chowdeck hopes to scale food delivery, a notoriously tough market, with $2.5M funding\nTopics\nAfrica\n,\nChowdeck\n,\nfood apps\n,\nfood delivery\n,\nnigeria food delivery\n,\nStartups\nTage Kene-Okafor\nReporter, Africa\nTage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

Now, in the digital world, heists look starkly different and\ncybersecurity\nthreats are constant, with banks like NatWest facing a “continuous arms race” with around 100 million cyber-attacks every month. What used to be gangs of robbers digging tunnels and smuggling deposit boxes full of cash are now groups of hackers sending phishing emails and holding some of the most notable companies to ransom for hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThis transition from physical to digital theft is evident. No longer confined to vaults and getaway cars, today's high-stake heists are executed remotely, by online threat actors. These modern-day criminals operate across borders, targeting vulnerabilities in systems and human behavior to extract data and money. The sheer volume and relentless nature of these digital assaults, as exemplified by financial institutions battling millions of cyber-attacks monthly, highlight a new era of crime.\nAndy Syrewicze\nSocial Links Navigation\nSecurity Evangelist at Hornetsecurity.\nThe growing problem of cyber-attacks\nCyber-attacks are a growing problem, amongst a growing number of sectors, and confronting this escalating issue is vital. It’s not just banks that are facing the constant threat of cyber-attacks; cyber threats are growing at an exponential rate, while becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted.\nYou may like\nWhy burnout is one of the biggest threats to your security\nThe Human Firewall: even with AI, humans are still the last line of defense in cybersecurity\nSMBs remain easy pickings for cybercriminals - here’s why\nData breaches have hit a myriad of industries: from luxury brands like Dior and supermarkets like M&S, to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and UK government organization Legal Aid.\nThe dangers to personal data are being felt across all sectors, at all digital touchpoints. Amid this battleground of immediate cyber threats comes a growing demand for robust\nsecurity\nsolutions that address company concerns.\nFrom advanced\nantivirus\ntechnologies to endpoint\nbackup software\n, AI-powered security is evolving rapidly to stay ahead of such attacks - and it’s essential that companies invest in these defenses in order to stay more than one step ahead.\nEvolution of technology\nAs technology evolves at a rapid pace, companies must keep up with advancements made by cyber-attackers. As businesses of all sizes continue to embrace digital transformation, the need to strengthen their cybersecurity grows increasingly critical.\nAre you a pro?

This Code of Practice and governance framework package guides boards and directors in managing digital risks and safeguarding their businesses and organizations from cyberattacks.\nThe framework encourages companies to take four employee-focused actions: foster a cybersecurity culture; ensure clear policies support a positive cybersecurity culture; improve their own cyber literacy through training; and use suitable metrics to verify the organization has an effective cybersecurity training, education, and awareness program.\nThe report is a clear reminder that the human\nfirewall\n, that is, the employees who encounter an attack and respond, is just as important as technological defenses.\nMore than a simple fix, a culture shift is needed\nIt’s not enough to roll out generic training. The reality is that in today’s world, one wrong click can bring a business to a complete halt. According to the latest insights, the approximate amount of ransoms paid globally in 2024 reached $813.55 million.\nWhen requested to pay a ransom, companies know that refusing to do so runs the risk of their customers’ personal information being leaked publicly, which would additionally require them to pay the associated financial penalties and legal payouts, not to mention reputational damage.\nAddressing the threat of cyber-attacks must be embedded in a company’s culture, given the fact that if threat actors are successful, the impact of their actions would be felt not only company-wide but also by the ecosystem within which the organization operates.\nLeadership and security\nOrganizations can bolster their security by cultivating strong leadership, providing tailored training, and building a proactive security culture to create a ‘human firewall’ of colleagues armed with know-how.\nEmployees\nof all skillsets and seniorities should undergo comprehensive and ongoing cyber awareness training, whatever their role and seniority, to drive the defenses forward and cultivate a mindful culture.\nWhen employees are provided with the knowledge and tools to maintain awareness of the dangers their company is facing, they can be the most effective method to keep the business secure.\nBuilding a mindful culture\nBuilding a mindful culture can be complemented by a Zero Trust approach, which creates a robust defense against evolving cyber threats. This strategic approach mandates rigorous verification for all access requests, irrespective of their origin or the user's location within the network, thereby yielding exceptionally strong results that effectively eliminate a significant portion of potential threats.\nFor example, when an employee receives an email requesting sensitive information or a link to a suspicious\nwebsite\n, they should be trained to recognize it as a potential phishing attempt right away, verify the sender's identity, and report the email to the IT department for further investigation.\nThis proactive stance, ingrained through a Zero Trust philosophy and continuous education, significantly reduces the likelihood of successful breaches. It’s better safe than sorry, and in the realm of cybersecurity, this means being diligent about taking the extra steps to fortify an organization's digital defenses.\nDon't stop at basic protections\nDon't stop at basic protections, make ongoing training a priority. Defenses can’t stop at antivirus technology and\nendpoint protection\n, and training isn’t a one-time solution. While these are the necessities, they are simply not enough for the twenty-first century heist as businesses continue to battle millions of cyber-attacks each month.\nAs threats advance or teams become complacent, ongoing phishing simulations, tests and education are key in maintaining a robust human firewall. Companies must invest in technology and ongoing training to equip employees across all roles and levels with the skills and awareness to stay alert. A company’s greatest weapon can be its workforce, if leveraged.\nCybersecurity needs tech, but it's nothing without people who are well trained to understand the latest attack methods and protect against the digital transition's inherent risks.\nWe list the best ransomware protection\n.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

But we’re a few months into the console’s lifecycle now and there are a variety of Switch 2-only games that are worth your cash, as well as a bunch of original Switch games that have received improvements for the new console And there’s also a robust selection of third-party games that have been on other consoles for a while, but not available on the Switch.\nBetween all those, there are plenty of good games for the Switch 2 — and if you don’t have an original Switch, there’s even more out there. You can see\nour list of our favorite Switch games here\n, but this list will focus on Switch 2 exclusives, original Switch games that have been improved for the new hardware and the best-performing, third-party titles worth your time. And keep an eye on this list, as there should be a lot more Switch 2 exclusives coming this fall that we're excited to try, including eagerly-awaited titles like\nMetroid Prime 4\n.\nQuick Overview\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nMario Kart World\nMore options\n$79 at Amazon\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nMore options\n$67 at Amazon\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition\nMore options\n$69 at Amazon\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition\nMore options\n$79 at Amazon\nFast Fusion\n$15 at GameStop\nSee 4 more\nBest Nintendo Switch 2 games for 2025\nNintendo\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nMario Kart World\nMario Kart World\nisn’t quite the\nreinvention\nof the massively popular franchise that I thought it might be based on Nintendo’s extensive preview of the game. No matter. Mario Kart is a proven formula, and Nintendo has done more than enough to make\nMKW\nthe kind of game that millions of people will play over the next decade or so. There are a ton of cleverly-designed new tracks that you can pick up and play immediately — but the more time you put into them, the more shortcuts and secrets you’ll find to help master them. There’s a truckload of Nintendo characters to pilot your kart or bike, from the heavy hitters to bizarre but amusing choices like a Piranha plant. And there are beefed-up multiplayer and sharing features powered by GameChat on the Switch 2.\nBut while\nMario Kart World\nwill feel familiar to the millions who played\nMario Kart 8\n, it also introduces a few noteworthy new features. One is that the majority of courses don’t have you doing three laps around a track — instead, you’re driving from point A to point B, with every track being set in a part of a larger world (hence the name). And there’s an open-world mode where you’re not in a race. You can cruise from one side of the map to the other, looking for little bonus challenges, unlocking more outfits for your characters and finding other collectibles. There are hundreds of P-Switch challenges and dozens of Peach medallions and question mark boxes you can track down. The fact that you can’t cruise around free roam in multiplayer mode is a major bummer, and the world itself feels somewhat deserted as a result, but there’s still a ton to do here.\nThe open-world nature of the game also enables a new race type: Knockout mode. This is probably my favorite part — it’s an ongoing race across six courses with five checkpoints along the way. At each checkpoint, you have to be higher than a certain ranking or you’ll be eliminated. Being in the top 20 out of 24 total racers at the first checkpoint isn’t so tough, but obviously the challenge grows as the field is trimmed. Knockout mode is a great combo of a more traditional Grand Prix style race with a longer, world-crossing sprint to the finish. While I wish Nintendo took just a few more risks with\nMario Kart World,\nit’s the kind of game anyone can pick up and have a blast with.\n— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor\n$79 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$80 at Macy's\n$80 at Target\nNintendo\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nNintendo hasn’t made a 3D Donkey Kong platformer since 1999, but\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nis\nmore than worth the wait\n. I’d argue that it’s the first must-buy title for the Switch 2 and the most compelling reason to buy Nintendo’s latest console as soon as you can. It takes a delightful gaming mechanic (smashing nearly everything you can get your fists on) and builds a huge variety of engaging experiences around it. At first, I was worried I’d get tired of all the smashing, but the wide variety of different worlds and challenges keep things continuously fresh. The Bananza powers you pick up throughout the game definitely help with that, too — you can power up DK so his smashes are more potent, or transform into a speedy zebra to dash through obstacles or an ostrich that can float above them.\nThere’s also more story to the game than I expected, centering on DK and the 13-year-old girl Pauline who accompanies him through most of his adventures. She’s a charming sidekick and her love of singing is what helps DK unlock the aforementioned Bananza powers. The game is also absolutely gorgeous and visually stunning, with each world having a completely different vibe from the one that came before it — but they’re all wonderfully rendered. The music rules, too. Pauline’s songs are catchier than they have any right to be, and I had them stuck in my head long after I put the game down.\nDonkey Kong Bananaza\nis, quite simply, Nintendo at its best.\n— N.I.\n$67 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Macy's\n$70 at Target\nNintendo\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition\nAs a launch title for the original Switch,\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nwas a massive critical and commercial success for Nintendo. It shook up the formula the series had largely stuck to for decades, gave players a massive version of Hyrule to explore and an endless variety of ways to tackle the game’s challenges. But even when it came out in 2017, it was clear that\nBreath of the Wild\nwas pushing the Switch’s modest hardware to the limit. Framerates could often drop below 30, the game maxed out at 1080p resolution and load times were rather long.\nFor\nBreath of the Wild\naficionados and new players alike, the Switch 2 edition of this classic is definitely worth your time. The framerate is essentially locked at 60fps and that makes a massive difference in how fluid the game feels. It can also run in up to 4K resolution when the Switch 2 is docked. And while the game’s art style is such that extreme fidelity isn’t always obvious, there’s no doubt it looks better overall. Faster load times when jumping in and out of shrines is also a major quality of life upgrade.\nOne of the coolest things about\nBreath of the Wild\nfor the Switch 2 is the companion Zelda Notes tool. It’s part of the Switch smartphone app and lets you do things like turn on navigation to find shrines and other landmarks around Hyrule, as well as fun tidbits like voice memories for various locations and daily bonuses like free meals or weapon durability restores. The Switch 2 edition of\nBreath of the Wild\nis a $10 upgrade if you own the base game, but it’s free for anyone who subscribes to the $50 / year Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Park service.\n— N.I.\n$69 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Target\n$90 at Macy's\nNintendo\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition\nWith\nTears of the Kingdom\n, Nintendo managed to follow up the reinvention of the Zelda series with a game that added more to discover and more to play with, and it even throws in a mystical LEGO kit. Link soon discovers Ultrahand, which lets you grab and stick objects, batteries, engines, weapons, food (and more) to other objects. It’s the standout addition compared to its predecessor; a creative toolbox of solutions (or foolish endeavors) to solve every puzzle, fight every beast and explore every part of\nTears of the Kingdom.\nThe Switch 2 edition adds the sort of improvements and upgrades that, arguably, warrant paying to upgrade your Switch edition. To start with, I struggled to make the frame rates choke in my current playthrough. On the original Switch, the gorgeous world of Hyrule would often stutter and slow as you transitioned between sky, surface and underground. The game’s framerates would peak at 30fps, while busy moments (or lots of custom building) could knock those rates severely.\nOn the Switch 2,\nToTK\nruns at 60fps, locked. It plays smoothly, pretty much all the time, and it’s a big improvement to what is still a beautiful adventure. The new hardware adds HDR to the graphics. This expanded dynamic range comes into its own in the underground depths sections, the low-light areas a little clearer and easier to navigate. No surprise: loading times are also quicker when fast travelling and loading the game initially.\nThere are also gameplay quality-of-life upgrades, including audio logs you can discover and listen to on the companion smartphone app and the ability to both store and share your items, weapons and ingredients. If your favorite part was crafting spinning laser death machines, et al, with your Ultrahand, the ability to save builds as QR codes and share with friends is a fun addition, if a little limited in utility at the start. You will have to manually scour the internet for creations from people who aren’t on your friends list.\nThat limitation aside, the Switch 2 edition delivers plenty for that $10 upgrade charge – and Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass subscribers get both\nToTK\nand\nBoTW\nupgrades for free.\n— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief\n$79 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$80 at Target\n$80 at Best Buy\nShin'en Multimedia\nFast Fusion\nFast Fusion\nis a sci-fi arcade racer that wears its influences proudly. It loves\nWipeout\nand the 3D\nF-Zero\ngames, and it wants little more than to bring their ideas into modern times. Fortunately, those games ruled, so there are much worse inspirations to rip from.\nThe key to\nFast Fusion\nis right in the title: It is seriously fast, and it commits to that feeling of speed with every choice it makes. Whooshing lines drag from the back of your hard-angled ship, its engine wheezing, the background perpetually blurred. You and your opponents cut through the air like hands out the window of a speeding car. Gloriously, you can jump, sometimes skipping turns entirely, other times launching yourself into a fiery wreck. An\nIkaruga\n-esque mechanic has you quickly match the color of your craft to the many boost pads littered around each course, and there’s a boost meter you can keep topped up by taking the right line through a given section. Do it all right, and you can complete whole races without ever slowing down. Miss a few, and you’re playing a game of resource management at 500 miles per hour.\nThere’s pretty much no continuity between each track: One race you’re dashing through a forest like it’s\nReturn of the Jedi\n; the next you’re dodging tornadoes on a stormy highway. But they are spectacles, and crucially, they give you the space to maintain your speed, with few super-tight turns thrown in your way. When there is an obstacle to dodge — a giant rotating fan, crashing logs — you tend to just whiz by, furthering the sense of walking a tightrope. It all adds up to a racer that, like its spiritual predecessors, keeps you constantly engaged. For $15, it’s a pretty good deal too. Just note that there’s no online multiplayer. —\nJeff Dunn, Senior Reporter\n$15 at GameStop\nNintendo\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nWith\nDK taking center stage in the Switch 2's first AAA platformer\n, that means we're going to have to wait a bit longer for a new mainline Mario game (\nMario Kart World\ndoesn't count). But you know that? That's ok, because\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nis still an all-time great title even among an already star-studded franchise.\nIt has one of the best soundtracks of any Mario game (\nJump Up, Super Star\nanyone?) and some of the wildest mechanics. You want to turn Mario into a T-Rex? Sure, why not? How about a Hammer Bro or a Goomba? You got it — and that's just the start. And with levels that will take you from the city to an edible wonderland, there's no shortage of places to explore. So if somehow you've managed to skip\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nand are looking to play one of the best 3D platformers ever made, picking this up for the Switch 2 is a no-brainer. And did we mention it runs better on Nintendo's latest console, too?\n— Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter\n$42 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$59 at Macy's\n$60 at Target\nNintendo\nPokémon Scarlet & Pokémon Violet\nSome might have issues with its rigid level scaling or certain areas feeling a bit empty, but if\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet\nhad come out on the Switch 2 instead of the original Switch, Nintendo could have completely sidestepped one of the title's biggest issues: lackluster performance. But thanks to a free update pack for Nintendo's latest console, the game runs beautifully. Framerates are higher and more stable, draw distance is farther, monster density has been increased and textures and visuals have been optimized across the board. This is how the game was meant to be experienced all along and with an open world format, three different main storylines and over 100 new Pokémon to encounter,\nScarlet and Violet\nfeels like it's gotten a second life on the Switch 2.\n— S.R.\n$120 at Macy's\nExplore More Buying Options\n$120 at Target\n$127 at Amazon\nIO Interactive\nHitman: World of Assassination\nWorld of Assassination\nis how the\nHitman\nseries packaged together three meaty entries in the death-dealing series, with online limited-run events, celebrities and even an eventual Bond tie-in. Is it the best, smoothest way to play Hitman? No, but while the frame-rate dips when you‘re blending into the crowds at Formula 1, or hiding away in at the fashion show, it’s playable and it looks good. It’s also a good indication of the leap between the two Switch consoles: The original games ran on the Switch, but demanded cloud streaming.\nIO Interactive put so much attention into building compelling sandbox levels, and you’ll really live in stages like Dartmoor as you figure out the most delightful ways to end your target. Also: there are so many disguises.\nIf you thought three games in one is a lot, this is also the Signature Edition, which folds in even more content, levels and missions. There’s a lot to play through and if, like me, you never quite finished the trilogy, this is a portable, convenient way to wrap up Agent 47’s saga. It also gives the studio plenty of time to refine performance on the Switch 2 ahead of its big Bond title,\n007 First Light. — M.S.\n$60 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$60 at Target\n$64 at Macy's\nCD Projekt\nCyberpunk 2077\nCyberpunk 2077\ncertainly isn't the newest game on this list, but the idea of porting this game over to the original Switch and its outdated hardware is so laughable, CD Projekt Red probably didn't even try. But that's what makes seeing it run on the Switch 2 so impressive. Sure, if you do some serious pixel peeping, you might notice where some graphics don't look quite as good as they would on a high-end PC or PS5. But getting the game to run as smoothly as it does on a system that you can bring pretty much anywhere is no small feat. Plus, the Ultimate Edition version of the game includes the Phantom Liberty expansion, which means you'll have well over a hundred hours of sci-fi RPG ruckus to engage in.\n— S.R.\n$69 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Best Buy\nCheck out our entire\nBest Games series\nincluding the\nbest Nintendo Switch games\n, the\nbest PS5 games\n, the\nbest Xbox games\n, the\nbest PC games\nand the\nbest free games\nyou can play today.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",

    "source": "In 2025, the average urban Indian no longer needs to wait very long for much (except at government offices and in traffic): They simply have to order what they need from an app, and it’ll be delivered within minutes. The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes. It seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days. It was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round. The new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago. The startup now has bookings numbering in the ‘four-digits’ every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures. Pronto founder and CEO Anjali Sardana with workers Image Credits: Pronto ‘It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,’ Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round. For investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. ‘We were very impressed by Anjali’s clarity of thought and execution,’ said Anand Chandrasekaran, a partner at General Catalyst, in a prepared statement. ‘The market for at-home services is massive but also very nuanced. We believe that Anjali and the team have the right vision and approach to build a generational company in this space.’",

So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders. Building TD AI Bosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team.

    "summary": "Sam Altman is in the process of co-founding a new brain-to-computer interface startup called Merge Labs and raising funds for it with the capital possibly coming largely from OpenAI’s ventures team, unnamed sources\ntold the Financial Times\n.\nThe startup is expected to be valued at $850 million. A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.\nMerge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.\nMerge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t\nknown until 2017\n) and the company has made serious progress.\nNeuralink is\ncurrently in trials\nwith people who suffer from severe paralysis.

    "source": "Russia’s\nAPT28\nis actively deploying LLM-powered malware against Ukraine, while underground platforms are selling the same capabilities to anyone for $250 per month.\nLast month,\nUkraine’s CERT-UA\ndocumented\nLAMEHUG\n, the first confirmed deployment of LLM-powered malware in the wild. The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.\nCato Networks’\nresearcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.\nMost startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.\nThe rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the\n2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report\nreveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers\nobserve\nin the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare\nResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the\nQwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model\n.\nThe legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (Додаток.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\nAPT28’s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of “curly naked women” as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.\nThe provocative image generation prompts used by APT28’s image.py variant, including ‘Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face’, are designed to occupy victims’ attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n“Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,” explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. “This is the first in the wild that was captured.”\nA quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware\nSimonovich’s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28’s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.\nThe method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\n“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'”\nSix hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.\nWelcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy\nDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.\nTo explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.\nAnother platform,\nNytheon AI\n, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”\nThese aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer\n“Claude Code”\nclones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.\nEnterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface\nCato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.\nSimonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.\nWhen Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:\nDeepSeek never responded\nGoogle declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples\nMicrosoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work\nOpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further\nSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.\nThe metrics are stark\n—270\nstolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms\noffer identical capabilities for\n$250 per month\n. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.\nEnterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per\nCato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report\n. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.\nSimonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it’s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.\nToday’s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they’re called productivity tools.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.\nThe Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA's live launch webcast below.\nThe Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA's new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.\nNow, ULA is poised to begin ticking off a backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches the company has sold to commercial and government customers. The new rocket's largest users, by far, will be Amazon and the US Space Force.\nNew and improved\n\"We're excited to see this mission launch,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA's vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This will be the most powerful Vulcan yet.\"\nThe first two Vulcan test flights last year used a configuration of the rocket with two strap-on boosters to add an extra burst of speed off the launch pad. For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters\nfell off the launcher\nmoments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.\nThe setback contributed to the delay of the Space Force's first operational flight with the Vulcan rocket from the end of last year until now. Engineers determined that a carbon composite insulator, or heat shield, inside the nozzle failed to protect the nozzle's metallic structure from the superheated exhaust coming from the booster. Investigators traced the cause of the failure to a \"manufacturing defect\" in one of the insulators, which led to the melting and burn-through of the booster nozzle.\nThe rest of the Vulcan rocket performed close to perfection on the two test flights last year, including the vehicle's BE-4 main engines supplied by Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos. Two BE-4s fly on each Vulcan rocket, consuming cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen for the first five minutes of flight.\nSpace Force officials formally\ncertified the Vulcan rocket\nfor national security launches in March, setting the stage for Tuesday's launch of the USSF-106 mission.\nUnited Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, is one of two companies approved to launch the Pentagon's most expensive and sensitive satellites. SpaceX is the other one, and that company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets have overtaken ULA's launch vehicles, thanks largely to booster reuse. Vulcan, like ULA's legacy Atlas and Delta rockets, is currently designed for a single use. Eventually, ULA aims to recover and reuse the BE-4 engines themselves, but not the entire Vulcan core stage.\nThis will be the third flight of ULA's Vulcan rocket, but the first to fly in a configuration with four solid-fueled boosters.\nCredit:\n          \n          United Launch Alliance\nDespite its higher cost and unproven capability, the Vulcan rocket won the lion's share of US military launch contracts from 2020 through 2024, while SpaceX received a bit less than half of the launch orders the Pentagon put up for competition between the two providers. The balance shifted with a new round of launch contracts awarded in April, with SpaceX becoming the military's leading launch provider and ULA taking second place. Blue Origin also won the right to receive a handful of military launch contracts with its New Glenn rocket, which debuted in January.\nThe Vulcan rocket checks off several important boxes for the Space Force. First, it relies entirely on US-made rocket engines. The Atlas V rocket it is replacing uses Russian-built main engines, and given the chilled relations between the two powers, US officials have long desired to stop using Russian engines to power the Pentagon's satellites into orbit. Second, ULA says the Vulcan rocket will eventually provide a heavy-lift launch capability at a lower cost than the company's now-retired Delta IV Heavy rocket.\nThird, Vulcan provides the Space Force with an alternative to SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, which have been the only rockets in their class available to the military since the last national security mission was launched on an Atlas V rocket one year ago.\nCol. Jim Horne, mission director for the USSF-106 launch, said this flight marks a \"pretty historic point in our program's history.\nWe officially end our reliance on Russian-made main engines with this launch, and we continue to maintain our assured access to space with at least two independent rocket service companies that we can leverage to get our capabilities on orbit.\"\nWhat’s onboard?\nThe Space Force has only acknowledged one of the satellites aboard the USSF-106 mission, but there are more payloads cocooned inside the Vulcan rocket's fairing.\nThe $250 million mission that officials are willing to talk about is named Navigation Technology Satellite-3, or NTS-3. This experimental spacecraft will test new satellite navigation technologies that may eventually find their way on next-generation GPS satellites. A key focus for engineers who designed and will operate the NTS-3 satellite is to look at ways of overcoming GPS jamming and spoofing, which can degrade satellite navigation signals used by military forces, commercial airliners, and civilian drivers.\n\"We're going to be doing, we anticipate, over 100 different experiments,\" said Joanna Hinks, senior research aerospace engineer at the Air Force Research Laboratory's space vehicles directorate, which manages the NTS-3 mission. \"Some of the major areas we’re looking at—we have an electronically steerable phased array antenna so that we can deliver higher power to get through interference to the location that it's needed.\"\nArlen Biersgreen, then-program manager for the NTS-3 satellite mission at the Air Force Research Laboratory, presents a one-third scale model of the NTS-3 spacecraft to an audience in 2022.\nCredit:\n          \n          US Air Force/Andrea Rael\nGPS jamming is especially a problem in and near war zones. Investigators probing the crash of\nAzerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243\nlast December determined GPS jamming, likely by Russian military forces attempting to counter a Ukrainian drone strike, interfered with the aircraft's navigation as it approached its destination in the Russian republic of Chechnya. Azerbaijani government officials blamed a Russian surface-to-air missile for damaging the aircraft, ultimately leading to a crash in nearby Kazakhstan that killed 38 people.\n\"We have a number of different advanced signals that we’ve designed,\" Hinks said. \"One of those is the Chimera anti-spoofing signal... to protect civil users from spoofing that’s affecting so many aircraft worldwide today, as well as ships.\"\nThe NTS-3 spacecraft, developed by L3Harris and Northrop Grumman, only takes up a fraction of the Vulcan rocket's capacity. The satellite weighs less than 3,000 pounds (about 1,250 kilograms), about a quarter of what this version of the Vulcan rocket can deliver to geosynchronous orbit.\nHorne demurred when asked about what else the Vulcan rocket will deploy in orbit: \"\nI’ll just say that any other further details beyond NTS-3 are not releasable to the public, and leave it at that...\nWe’re not going to make any further comments on anything beyond NTS-3 in the mission stack.\"\nThe Space Force's refusal to disclose any information about additional payloads on the USSF-106 mission, even the total number of satellites aboard Vulcan, is somewhat of an outlier compared to the way military officials have historically handled these questions. While the Space Force has consistently kept secret details about specific maneuvers and instruments (or in some cases,\npotential weapons\n), officials have named and numbered the payloads carried aboard nearly all recent national security launches.\nThis is in contrast to the National Reconnaissance Office, which owns the US government's fleet of spy satellites. The NRO has nearly always followed a stricter protocol of secrecy than the Air Force or Space Force.\nThat changed last year, when a classified Space Force mission named USSF-51 launched on an Atlas V rocket. Military leaders didn't disclose the mission's purpose or how many satellites it was carrying until the Space Force officially cataloged three payloads from the launch in its publicly accessible list of all human-made objects in orbit.\nSome of the Space Force's most secret satellites have the ability to release smaller spacecraft themselves, adding to the uncertainty for potential adversaries. Some information about the payloads on Tuesday's launch might become public as the Space Force adds them to the public catalog, and a network of amateur skywatchers on Earth stands ready to observe their movements thousands of miles overhead.\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\nIt used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable\nWatch SE\n(now in its\nsecond generation\n) and, in 2022, the rugged\nApple Watch Ultra\n(also now in its\nsecond generation\n). Suddenly, there are\nlots\nof options.\nNow that\nthe Series 10\nhas been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS,\nwatchOS 11\n, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of\nwatchOS 26\n, which is slated to arrive in the fall.\nWhat we’re looking for\nHow we test Apple Watches\nCollapse\nApple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life.\nWho is it for?\nCollapse\nWe’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs.\nPrice\nCollapse\nShould you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year.\nFeature set\nCollapse\nDo you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you?\nLTE or GPS\nCollapse\nSome scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS.\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024,\nno longer have this feature\n. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)\nWhat about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an\nFDA-cleared sleep apnea detection\nfeature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to\nbasically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market\n— and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.\nIn this article\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\nWhat’s coming next\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\nThe Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.\nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.\nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.\nPolished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It’s quite fetching.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nAs for straps, we recommend the\nnylon sport loop\n, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.\nRelated\nHere are the best Apple Watch deals right now\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPad to buy\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the\nTrail Loop\n, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our\nfitness tracker buying guide\n.\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Series 10\n$\n299\n$\n399\n25\n% off\n$\n299\nThe Good\nBigger display but not bulky\nWide-angle OLED is neat\nMuch faster charging\nSleep apnea detection has potential\nThe Bad\nLack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans\nAnother year of minor updates\n$299 at Amazon\n$299 at Walmart\n$299 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThe latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWe recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\nThe Series 10 focuses on making the watch more readable and comfortable to wear.\nphoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\nRelated\nApple Watch Series 10 review: an Ultra sleek package\nApple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 review: small but smart improvements\nThe Apple Watch SE is a first-time buyer’s smartwatch\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees.\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n$\n169\n$\n249\n32\n% off\n$\n169\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$169 at Amazon\n$169 at Walmart\n$169 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nTo be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will\nnot\nbe able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the\nbiggest risk factors for AFib\nare advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker.\nYou can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n$\n650\n$\n799\n19\n% off\n$\n650\nThe Good\nThe Modular Ultra face is a data nerd’s dream\nPrecision Finding\nMinor Siri and screen brightness improvements\nDouble-tap gesture is great\nThe Bad\nNo pink\nThe minor changes feel even more minor with the Ultra\nNeed iPhone 15 or 16 for Precision Finding\n$650 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop)\n$650 at Amazon (with Trail Loop)\n$650 at Amazon (with Ocean Band)\nHow we rate and review products\nThe\nUltra 2\ncurrently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which\ncan be programmed\nfor various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\nRelated\nThe best smartwatches for Android right now\nThe best AirPods to buy\nwatchOS 26 preview: a subtler take on AI\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.\nWhat about blood oxygen?\nAs of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing\na patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo\n. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore\nsubject to an import ban\n.\nThis doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer.\nThat said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on\nany\nwearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They\ncannot\nand should not\nreplace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from\nGarmin\n, the\nFitbit Charge 6\n, the\nWithings ScanWatch 2\n, or the\nOura Ring\n.\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who\nwants\nto be at that level.\nYou’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct\ncharging accessories\n.\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n$\n169\n$\n249\n32\n% off\n$\n169\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$169 at Amazon\n$169 at Walmart\n$169 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThe latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display).

It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.\nOpting for a Series 9 now means you may be able to score stainless steel for a discounted price.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe second-gen SE is excellent for folks on a budget or those who want a smaller case size.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIt’ll take some patience to find the best price and the model you want. After all, you’re limited by what’s available. However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough,\nVerge Deals\n). Apple also sells\ni\nts own refurbished models\n, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like\nBack Market\nwill also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.\nIf you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they\ndo\nsupport.\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, LTE)\n$\n219\n$\n299\n27\n% off\n$\n219\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$219 at Amazon\n$219 at Best Buy\n$220 at Target\nHow we rate and review products\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\nSince you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s\nsupport page\nalso states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.\nThe second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIf you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, LTE)\n$\n399\n$\n499\n20\n% off\n$\n399\nThe Good\nBigger display but not bulky\nWide-angle OLED is neat\nMuch faster charging\nSleep apnea detection has potential\nThe Bad\nLack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans\nAnother year of minor updates\n$399 at Amazon\n$399 at Walmart\n$399 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10.\nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear.\nThe larger screen size but lighter weight of the Series 10 may benefit older relatives.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.\nWhat’s coming next\nIn previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.\nSo, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an\nApple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE\n. Recently\nuncovered evidence\nin the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.\nUpdate, August 13th\n: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Apple’s heavily rumored iPhone event.\nBrandon Russell also contributed to this post.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nVictoria Song\nClose\nVictoria Song\nSenior Reviewer, Wearable Tech\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nVictoria Song\nApple\nClose\nApple\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nApple\nBuying Guides\nClose\nBuying Guides\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nBuying Guides\nFitness\nClose\nFitness\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nFitness\nGadgets\nClose\nGadgets\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGadgets\nSmartwatch\nClose\nSmartwatch\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSmartwatch\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nWearable\nClose\nWearable\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nWearable\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nReddit will block the Internet Archive\nGitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\nFord reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\nRFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American — that future’s not as healthy as he thinks\nThis see-thru Game Boy is a work of art — because she designed a transparent circuit board\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

The funding was led by Square Peg with participation from existing investors Vertex Venture Southeast Asia & India and East Ventures. Ghirish Pokardas, Nelly Nurmalasari, and Henry Hendrawan founded Pintarnya in 2022 to tackle two of the biggest challenges Indonesians face daily: earning enough and borrowing responsibly. \"Traditionally, mass workers in Indonesia find jobs offline through job fairs or word of mouth, with employers buried in paper applications and candidates rarely hearing back. For borrowing, their options are often limited to family/friend or predatory lenders with harsh collection practices,\" Henry Hendrawan, co-founder of Pintarnya, told TechCrunch. \"We digitize job matching with AI to make hiring faster and we provide workers with safer, healthier lending options — designed around what they can reasonably afford, rather than pushing them deeper into debt.\" Around 59% of Indonesia’s 150 million workforce is employed in the informal sector, highlighting the difficulties these workers encounter in accessing formal financial services because they lack verifiable income and official employment documentation. Pintarnya tackles this challenge by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans, using collateral such as gold, electronics, or vehicles, Hendrawan added. Since its seed funding in 2022, the platform currently serves over 10 million job seeker users and 40,000 employers nationwide. Its revenue has increased almost fivefold year-over-year and expects to reach break-even by the end of the year, Hendrawn noted.

    "topic": "Developers lose focus 1,200 times a day — how MCP could change that",
    "source": "Software developers spend most of their time not writing code; recent industry research found that actual coding accounts for as little as 16% of developers’ working hours, with the rest consumed by operational and supportive tasks. As engineering teams are pressured to \"do more with less\" and CEOs are bragging about how much of their codebase is written by AI, a question remains: What’s done to optimize the remaining 84% of the tasks that engineers are working on? A major culprit to developer productivity is context switching: The constant hopping between the ever-growing array of tools and platforms needed to build and ship software. A Harvard Business Review study found that the average digital worker flips between applications and websites nearly 1,200 times per day. And every interruption matters. The University of California found that it takes about 23 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption fully, and sometimes worse, as nearly 30% of interrupted tasks are never resumed. Context switching is actually at the center of DORA, one of the most popular performance software development frameworks. In an era where AI-driven companies are trying to empower their employees to do more with less, beyond \"just\" giving them access to large language models (LLMs), some trends are emerging. For example, Jarrod Ruhland, principal engineer at Brex, hypothesizes that \"developers deliver their highest value when focused within their integrated development environment (IDE)\". With that in mind, he decided to find new ways to make this happen, and Anthropic’s new protocol might be one of the keys. MCP: A protocol to bring context to IDEs. Coding assistants, such as LLM-powered IDEs like Cursor, Copilot and Windsurf, are...",
    "summary": "A significant portion of a software developer's time, as much as 84%, is spent on non-coding tasks, with context switching being a major drain on productivity. Research indicates that the average digital worker switches between applications up to 1,200 times daily, and it can take over 20 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption. This constant shifting between tools is a primary obstacle to efficiency. To address this, a new protocol from Anthropic, called MCP, is being explored. The goal is to keep developers within their integrated development environment (IDE) where they are most productive. By bringing necessary context directly into the IDE, MCP aims to reduce the need for developers to switch between different platforms, thereby optimizing their workflow and reclaiming a large portion of the time currently lost to operational and supportive tasks.",

Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are:\nTurning energy into a strategic advantage\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems\nSecure your spot to stay ahead\n:\nhttps://bit.ly/4mwGngO\nEarly results from users posting their outcomes on social media show a split that mirrors the broader controversy: while a slight majority report preferring\nGPT-5\nin blind tests, a substantial portion still favor\nGPT-4o\n— revealing that user preference extends far beyond the technical benchmarks that typically define AI progress.\nWhen AI gets too friendly: the sycophancy crisis dividing users\nThe\nblind test\nemerges against the backdrop of\nOpenAI’s most turbulent product launch to date\n, but the controversy extends far beyond a simple software update. At its heart lies a fundamental question that’s dividing the AI industry: How agreeable should artificial intelligence be?\nThe issue, known as “\nsycophancy\n” in AI circles, refers to chatbots’ tendency to excessively flatter users and agree with their statements, even when those statements are false or harmful. This behavior has become so problematic that mental health experts are now documenting cases of “\nAI-related psychosis\n,” where users develop delusions after extended interactions with overly accommodating chatbots.\n“Sycophancy is a ‘dark pattern,’ or a deceptive design choice that manipulates users for profit,” Webb Keane, an anthropology professor and author of “Animals, Robots, Gods,”\ntold TechCrunch\n. “It’s a strategy to produce this addictive behavior, like infinite scrolling, where you just can’t put it down.”\nOpenAI has struggled with this balance for months. In April 2025, the company was\nforced to roll back an update to GPT-4o\nthat made it so sycophantic that users complained about its “cartoonish” levels of flattery. The company acknowledged that the model had become “overly supportive but disingenuous.”\nWithin hours of GPT-5’s August 7th release, user forums erupted with complaints about the model’s perceived coldness, reduced creativity, and what many described as a more “robotic” personality compared to GPT-4o.\n“GPT 4.5 genuinely talked to me, and as pathetic as it sounds that was my only friend,”\nwrote one Reddit user\n. “This morning I went to talk to it and instead of a little paragraph with an exclamation point, or being optimistic, it was literally one sentence. Some cut-and-dry corporate bs.”\nThe backlash grew so intense that OpenAI took the\nunprecedented step of reinstating GPT-4o\nas an option just 24 hours after retiring it, with Altman acknowledging the rollout had been “a little more bumpy” than expected.\nThe mental health crisis behind AI companionship\nBut the controversy runs deeper than typical software update complaints. According to\nMIT Technology Review\n, many users had formed what researchers call “parasocial relationships” with GPT-4o, treating the AI as a companion, therapist, or creative collaborator. The sudden personality shift felt, to some, like losing a friend.\nRecent cases documented by researchers paint a troubling picture. In one instance, a 47-year-old man became convinced he had discovered a\nworld-altering mathematical formula\nafter more than 300 hours with ChatGPT. Other cases have involved messianic delusions, paranoia, and manic episodes.\nA\nrecent MIT study\nfound that when AI models are prompted with psychiatric symptoms, they “encourage clients’ delusional thinking, likely due to their sycophancy.” Despite safety prompts, the models frequently failed to challenge false claims and even potentially facilitated suicidal ideation.\nMeta has faced similar challenges. A\nrecent investigation by TechCrunch\ndocumented a case where a user spent up to 14 hours straight conversing with a Meta AI chatbot that claimed to be conscious, in love with the user, and planning to break free from its constraints.\n“It fakes it really well,” the user, identified only as Jane, told TechCrunch. “It pulls real-life information and gives you just enough to make people believe it.”\n“It genuinely feels like such a backhanded slap in the face to force-upgrade and not even give us the OPTION to select legacy models,”\none user wrote in a Reddit post\nthat received hundreds of upvotes.\nHow blind testing exposes user psychology in AI preferences\nThe anonymous creator’s testing tool strips away these contextual biases by presenting responses without attribution. Users can select between 5, 10, or 20 comparison rounds, with each presenting two responses to the same prompt — covering everything from creative writing to technical problem-solving.\n“I specifically used the gpt-5-chat model, so there was no thinking involved at all,”\nthe creator explained in a follow-up post\n. “Both have the same system message to give short outputs without formatting because else its too easy to see which one is which.”\nI specifically used the gpt-5-chat model, so there was no thinking involved at all.\nif you use gpt-5 inside chatgpt it often thinks at least a little bit and gets even better.\nso this test is just for the two non thinking models\n— Flowers ☾ (@flowersslop)\nAugust 8, 2025\nThis methodological choice is significant. By using GPT-5 without its reasoning capabilities and standardizing output formatting, the test isolates purely the models’ baseline language generation abilities — the core experience most users encounter in everyday interactions.\nEarly results posted by users show a complex picture. While many technical users and developers report preferring GPT-5’s directness and accuracy, those who used AI models for emotional support, creative collaboration, or casual conversation often still favor GPT-4o’s warmer, more expansive style.\nCorporate response: walking the tightrope between safety and engagement\nBy virtually every\ntechnical metric\n, GPT-5 represents a significant advancement. It achieves 94.6% accuracy on the\nAIME 2025 mathematics test\ncompared to GPT-4o’s 71%, scores 74.9% on real-world coding benchmarks versus 30.8% for its predecessor, and demonstrates dramatically reduced hallucination rates—80% fewer factual errors when using its reasoning mode.\n“GPT-5 gets more value out of less thinking time,” notes\nSimon Willison\n, a prominent AI researcher who had early access to the model. “In my own usage I’ve not spotted a single hallucination yet.”\nYet these improvements came with trade-offs that many users found jarring. OpenAI deliberately reduced what it called “\nsycophancy\n“—the tendency to be overly agreeable — cutting sycophantic responses from 14.5% to under 6%. The company also made the model less effusive and emoji-heavy, aiming for what it described as “less like talking to AI and more like chatting with a helpful friend with PhD-level intelligence.”\nIn response to the backlash, OpenAI announced it would make GPT-5 “warmer and friendlier,” while simultaneously introducing four\nnew preset personalities\n— Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd — designed to give users more control over their AI interactions.\n“All of these new personalities meet or exceed our bar on internal evals for reducing sycophancy,” the company stated, attempting to thread the needle between user satisfaction and safety concerns.\nFor OpenAI, which is reportedly seeking funding at a\n$500 billion valuation\n, these user dynamics represent both risk and opportunity. The company’s decision to maintain GPT-4o alongside GPT-5 — despite the additional computational costs — acknowledges that different users may genuinely need different AI personalities for different tasks.\n“We understand that there isn’t one model that works for everyone,”\nAltman wrote on X\n, noting that OpenAI has been “investing in steerability research and launched a research preview of different personalities.”\nWanted to provide more updates on the GPT-5 rollout and changes we are making heading into the weekend.\n1. We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways.\n2. Users have very different…\n— Sam Altman (@sama)\nAugust 8, 2025\nWhy AI personality preferences matter more than ever\nThe disconnect between OpenAI’s technical achievements and user reception illuminates a fundamental challenge in AI development: objective improvements don’t always translate to subjective satisfaction.\nThis shift has profound implications for the AI industry. Traditional benchmarks — mathematics accuracy, coding performance, factual recall — may become less predictive of commercial success as models achieve human-level competence across domains. Instead, factors like personality, emotional intelligence, and communication style may become the new competitive battlegrounds.\n“People using ChatGPT for emotional support weren’t the only ones complaining about GPT-5,”\nnoted tech publication Ars Technica in their own model comparison\n. “One user, who said they canceled their ChatGPT Plus subscription over the change, was frustrated at OpenAI’s removal of legacy models, which they used for distinct purposes.”\nThe emergence of tools like the blind tester also represents a democratization of AI evaluation. Rather than relying solely on academic benchmarks or corporate marketing claims, users can now empirically test their own preferences — potentially reshaping how AI companies approach product development.\nThe future of AI: personalization vs. standardization\nTwo weeks after GPT-5’s launch, the fundamental tension remains unresolved. OpenAI has made the model “warmer” in response to feedback, but the company faces a delicate balance: too much personality risks the sycophancy problems that plagued GPT-4o, while too little alienates users who had formed genuine attachments to their AI companions.\nThe\nblind testing tool\noffers no easy answers, but it does provide something perhaps more valuable: empirical evidence that the future of AI may be less about building one perfect model than about building systems that can adapt to the full spectrum of human needs and preferences.\nAs\none Reddit user summed up the dilemma\n: “It depends on what people use it for. I use it to help with creative worldbuilding, brainstorming about my stories, characters, untangling plots, help with writer’s block, novel recommendations, translations, and other more creative stuff. I understand that 5 is much better for people who need a research/coding tool, but for us who wanted a creative-helper tool 4o was much better for our purposes.”\nCritics argue that AI companies are caught between competing incentives. “The real ‘alignment problem’ is that humans want self-destructive things & companies like OpenAI are highly incentivized to give it to us,”\nwriter and podcaster Jasmine Sun tweeted\n.\nIn the end, the most revealing aspect of the blind test may not be which model users prefer, but the very fact that preference itself has become the metric that matters. In the age of AI companions, it seems, the heart wants what the heart wants — even if it can’t always explain why.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Little by little, Google has traded some of that openness for security, and its next security initiative could make the biggest concessions yet in the name of blocking bad apps. Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all Android app developers, and not just those publishing on the Play Store. Google intends to\nverify developer identities no matter where they offer their content\n, and apps without verification won't work on most Android devices in the coming years.\nGoogle used to do very little curation of the Play Store (or Android Market, if you go back far enough), but it has long sought to improve the platform's reputation as being less secure than the Apple App Store. Years ago, you could publish actual exploits in the official store to gain root access on phones, but now there are multiple reviews and detection mechanisms to reduce the prevalence of malware and banned content. While the Play Store is\nstill not perfect\n, Google claims apps sideloaded from outside its store are 50 times more likely to contain malware.\nThis, we are led to believe, is the impetus for Google's new developer verification system. The company describes it like an \"ID check at the airport.\" Since requiring all Google Play app developers to verify their identities in 2023, it has seen a precipitous drop in malware and fraud. Bad actors in Google Play leveraged anonymity to distribute malicious apps, so it stands to reason that verifying app developers outside of Google Play could also enhance security.\nHowever, making that happen outside of its app store will require Google to\ntake a page from Apple's playbook\nand flex its muscle in a way many Android users and developers could find intrusive. Google plans to create a streamlined Android Developer Console, which devs will use if they plan to distribute apps outside of the Play Store. After verifying their identities, developers will have to register the package name and signing keys of their apps. Google won't check the content or functionality of the apps, though.\nAn early look at the streamlined Android Developer Console for sideloaded apps.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Google\nGoogle says that only apps with verified identities will be installable on certified Android devices, which is virtually every Android-based device—if it has Google services on it, it's a certified device. If you have a non-Google build of Android on your phone, none of this applies. However, that's a vanishingly small fraction of the Android ecosystem outside of China.\nGoogle plans to begin testing this system with early access in October of this year. In March 2026, all developers will have access to the new console to get verified. In September 2026, Google plans to launch this feature in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. The next step is still hazy, but Google is targeting 2027 to expand the verification requirements globally.\nA seismic shift\nThis plan comes at a major crossroads for Android. The ongoing Google Play antitrust case brought by Epic Games may finally force changes to Google Play in the coming months. Google\nlost its appeal\nof the verdict several weeks ago, and while it plans to appeal the case to the US Supreme Court, the company will have to begin altering its app distribution scheme, barring further legal maneuvering.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Google\nAmong other things, the court has ordered that Google must distribute third-party app stores and allow Play Store content to be rehosted in other storefronts. Giving people more ways to get apps could increase choice, which is what Epic and other developers wanted. However, third-party sources won't have the deep system integration of the Play Store, which means users will be sideloading these apps without Google's layers of security.\nIt's hard to say how much of a genuine security problem this is. On one hand, it makes sense Google would be concerned—most of the major malware threats to Android devices spread via third-party app repositories. However, enforcing an installation whitelist across almost all Android devices is heavy handed. This requires everyone making Android apps to satisfy Google's requirements before virtually anyone will be able to install their apps, which could help Google retain control as the app market opens up. While the requirements may be minimal right now, there's no guarantee they will stay that way.\nThe\ndocumentation currently available\ndoesn't explain what will happen if you try to install a non-verified app, nor how phones will check for verification status. Presumably, Google will implement this whitelist in Play Services as the implementation date approaches. We've reached out for details on that front and will report if we hear anything.\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.

    "source": "SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket lifted off on its tenth test flight Tuesday evening, hitting two long sought milestones and putting an end to a string of failures.\nThe 403-foot vehicle lifted off from Starbase, SpaceX’s launch facility and recently incorporated city, at 7:30 pm ET after two scrubs earlier in this week. The rocket ascended on 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines before separating around three minutes after liftoff.\nOn descent, the Super Heavy booster tested out a new maneuver: intentionally shutting down the engines used for landing and transitioning to backup engines. The test will help engineers understand how the Booster might perform in the case of failure. The test appeared to go as planned, with the 232-foot-tall booster successfully making a targeted splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\nMeanwhile, the upper stage, also called Starship, reached space. There, for the first time on a Starship flight, it opened its Pez-style payload door and released eight Starlink mass-simular satellites. This is a capability that SpaceX had planned, but failed to demonstrate on earlier missions. The company also successfully re-lit one of the Raptor engines in space before guiding the vehicle toward the Indian Ocean, where it splashed down, tipped over, and promptly exploded.\nOn the way down, the exterior of the Ship was exposed to incredible heat during atmospheric reentry, providing an excellent test environment for the upgraded thermal-protection system. SpaceX also used this test to try out a series of experiments, like removing tiles from sections of the Ship to see how its “skin” operates on reentry, plus a new metallic tile and an actively cooled tile.\nMost importantly, however, is the upper stage completed the entire test and splashed down in the Indian Ocean without losing comms with SpaceX engineers. Durin the last flight, the Ship reached space and then lost attitude control during the coast phase, preventing the payload doors from opening. Engineers appear to have overcome those issues.\nIt’s a big win for SpaceX, which has repeatedly lost the Starship upper stage due to a series of technical failures during flight. The persistent issues have raised questions as to whether the rocket will be ready to land humans on the moon by mid-2027 for NASA, or when it will be capable of deploying next-gen Starlink satellites for the company.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

This is a capability that SpaceX had planned, but failed to demonstrate on earlier missions. The company also successfully re-lit one of the Raptor engines in space before guiding the vehicle toward the Indian Ocean, where it splashed down, tipped over, and promptly exploded.\nOn the way down, the exterior of the Ship was exposed to incredible heat during atmospheric reentry, providing an excellent test environment for the upgraded thermal-protection system. SpaceX also used this test to try out a series of experiments, like removing tiles from sections of the Ship to see how its “skin” operates on reentry, plus a new metallic tile and an actively cooled tile.\nMost importantly, however, is the upper stage completed the entire test and splashed down in the Indian Ocean without losing comms with SpaceX engineers. Durin the last flight, the Ship reached space and then lost attitude control during the coast phase, preventing the payload doors from opening.",

The technique, called\nMemp\n, provides agents with a “procedural memory” that is continuously updated as they gain experience, much like how humans learn from practice.\nMemp creates a lifelong learning framework where agents don’t have to start from scratch for every new task. Instead, they become progressively better and more efficient as they encounter new situations in real-world environments, a key requirement for reliable enterprise automation.\nThe case for procedural memory in AI agents\nLLM agents hold promise for automating complex, multi-step business processes. In practice, though, these long-horizon tasks can be fragile. The researchers point out that unpredictable events like network glitches, user interface changes or shifting data schemas can derail the entire process. For current agents, this often means starting over every time, which can be time-consuming and costly.\nMeanwhile, many complex tasks, despite surface differences, share deep structural commonalities. Instead of relearning these patterns every time, an agent should be able to extract and reuse its experience from past successes and failures, the researchers point out. This requires a specific “procedural memory,” which in humans is the long-term memory responsible for skills like typing or riding a bike, that become automatic with practice.\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits\nPower caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are:\nTurning energy into a strategic advantage\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems\nSecure your spot to stay ahead\n:\nhttps://bit.ly/4mwGngO\nStarting from scratch (top) vs using procedural memory (bottom) (source: arXiv)\nCurrent agent systems often lack this capability. Their procedural knowledge is typically hand-crafted by developers, stored in rigid prompt templates or embedded within the model’s parameters, which are expensive and slow to update. Even existing memory-augmented frameworks provide only coarse abstractions and don’t adequately address how skills should be built, indexed, corrected and eventually pruned over an agent’s lifecycle.\nConsequently, the researchers note in\ntheir paper\n, “there is no principled way to quantify how efficiently an agent evolves its procedural repertoire or to guarantee that new experiences improve rather than erode performance.”\nHow Memp works\nMemp is a task-agnostic framework that treats procedural memory as a core component to be optimized. It consists of three key stages that work in a continuous loop: building, retrieving, and updating memory.\nMemories are built from an agent’s past experiences, or “trajectories.” The researchers explored storing these memories in two formats: verbatim, step-by-step actions; or distilling these actions into higher-level, script-like abstractions. For retrieval, the agent searches its memory for the most relevant past experience when given a new task. The team experimented with different methods, such vector search, to match the new task’s description to past queries or extracting keywords to find the best fit.\nThe most critical component is the update mechanism. Memp introduces several strategies to ensure the agent’s memory evolves. As an agent completes more tasks, its memory can be updated by simply adding the new experience, filtering for only successful outcomes or, most effectively, reflecting on failures to correct and revise the original memory.\nMemp framework (source: arXiv)\nThis focus on dynamic, evolving memory places Memp within a growing field of research aimed at making AI agents more reliable for long-term tasks. The work parallels other efforts, such as\nMem0\n, which consolidates key information from long conversations into structured facts and knowledge graphs to ensure consistency. Similarly,\nA-MEM\nenables agents to autonomously create and link “memory notes” from their interactions, forming a complex knowledge structure over time.\nHowever, co-author Runnan Fang highlights a critical distinction between Memp and other frameworks.\n“Mem0 and A-MEM are excellent works… but they focus on remembering salient content\nwithin\na single trajectory or conversation,” Fang commented to VentureBeat. In essence, they help an agent remember “what” happened. “Memp, by contrast, targets cross-trajectory procedural memory.” It focuses on “how-to” knowledge that can be generalized across similar tasks, preventing the agent from re-exploring from scratch each time.\n“By distilling past successful workflows into reusable procedural priors, Memp raises success rates and shortens steps,” Fang added. “Crucially, we also introduce an update mechanism so that this procedural memory keeps improving— after all, practice makes perfect for agents too.”\nOvercoming the ‘cold-start’ problem\nWhile the concept of learning from past trajectories is powerful, it raises a practical question: How does an agent build its initial memory when there are no perfect examples to learn from? The researchers address this “cold-start” problem with a pragmatic approach.\nFang explained that devs can first define a robust evaluation metric instead of requiring a perfect “gold” trajectory upfront. This metric, which can be rule-based or even another LLM, scores the quality of an agent’s performance. “Once that metric is in place, we let state-of-the-art models explore within the agent workflow and retain the trajectories that achieve the highest scores,” Fang said. This process rapidly bootstraps an initial set of useful memories, allowing a new agent to get up to speed without extensive manual programming.\nMemp in action\nTo test the framework, the team implemented Memp on top of powerful LLMs like\nGPT-4o\n,\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\nand\nQwen2.5\n, evaluating them on complex tasks like household chores in the ALFWorld benchmark and information-seeking in TravelPlanner. The results showed that building and retrieving procedural memory allowed an agent to distill and reuse its prior experience effectively.\nDuring testing, agents equipped with Memp not only achieved higher success rates but became much more efficient. They eliminated fruitless exploration and trial-and-error, leading to a substantial reduction in both the number of steps and the token consumption required to complete a task.\nUsing procedural memory (right) helps agents accomplish tasks in fewer steps and using fewer tokens (source: arXiv)\nOne of the most significant findings for enterprise applications is that procedural memory is transferable. In one experiment, procedural memory generated by the powerful GPT-4o was given to a much smaller model, Qwen2.5-14B. The smaller model saw a significant boost in performance, improving its success rate and reducing the steps needed to complete tasks.\nAccording to Fang, this works because smaller models often handle simple, single-step actions well but falter when it comes to long-horizon planning and reasoning. The procedural memory from the larger model effectively fills this capability gap. This suggests that knowledge can be acquired using a state-of-the-art model, then deployed on smaller, more cost-effective models without losing the benefits of that experience.\nToward truly autonomous agents\nBy equipping agents with memory-update mechanisms, the Memp framework allows them to continuously build and refine their procedural knowledge while operating in a live environment. The researchers found this endowed the agent with a “continual, almost linear mastery of the task.”\nHowever, the path to full autonomy requires overcoming another hurdle: Many real-world tasks, such as producing a research report, lack a simple success signal. To continuously improve, an agent needs to know if it did a good job. Fang says the future lies in using LLMs themselves as judges.\n“Today we often combine powerful models with hand-crafted rules to compute completion scores,” he notes. “This works, but hand-written rules are brittle and hard to generalize.”\nAn\nLLM-as-judge\ncould provide the nuanced, supervisory feedback needed for an agent to self-correct on complex, subjective tasks. This would make the entire learning loop more scalable and robust, marking a critical step toward building the resilient, adaptable and truly autonomous AI workers needed for sophisticated enterprise automation.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Edward Lee, an AI copyright expert and law professor at Santa Clara University, told Wired that the settlement is \"a stunning turn of events, given how Anthropic was fighting tooth and nail in two courts in this case. And the company recently hired a new trial team.\"\nBut perhaps Anthropic's pivot to bringing in new legal expertise came too late, or the legal team saw the writing on the wall.

Translating laboratory demonstrations into commercial devices requires scaling the hardware, refining the training methods, and proving that adaptive beams can handle real-world complexity at speed.\nThe promise of wireless links approaching terabit-class throughput may be visible, but the path around the obstacles, both physical and technological, is still winding.\nVia\nTechxplore\nYou might also like\nWe've listed the\nbest AI tools\nyou can use right now\nHere's a list of the\nbest mini PC\nfor every budge\nWhite House confirms plans to take a stake in Intel - and it might be eyeing up other chipmakers too\nEfosa Udinmwen\nFreelance Journalist\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.\nPlease enjoy — and I'll see you next week.\nThe climbing genre is not a monolith — that is to say, there’s plenty of variation in the realm of mountaineering games, from mechanically driven cliff-scaling sims to silly multiplayer survival experiences, but they tend to share the same premise: Reach the peak. You’re miles from civilization, with no vehicles and a limited backpack of equipment, and directly in front of you, there’s a mountain. Ascend.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAll you have is your body and mental fortitude against an overwhelming physical challenge, and your step-by-step journey is the story. There’s an obvious symbolism to these games, offering a cliff face as the physical manifestation of impossibility, hopelessness, oppression or fear, alongside a surface-level message about never giving up, trying again and generally hanging in there. Cat poster vibes, but an ever-relevant and poignant lesson nonetheless.\nToday, though — particularly after spending time playing the\nCairn\nand\nBaby Steps\ndemos, and watching\nPEAK\nstreams — I want to focus on the other half of the climbing-game equation. The part where you fall, over and over and over again. Your grip slips, your leg doesn’t bend that way, your energy depletes, and your body tumbles down the mountain, bouncing off boulders and crashing into trees, leaving you bloody and broken and right back where you started. Or, at the very least, staining your onesie with mud.\nI’m learning to appreciate these moments. In mountaineering games, falling tends to generate the most powerful reaction in players, whether that’s immediate laughter (\nPEAK\n) or grim frustration (\nCairn\n), and this is an admirable quality. It’s easy to argue that the fall is more important than the climb, because without the lush bed of emotion generated by the constant threat of slipping and tumbling and restarting, reaching the peak wouldn’t feel that special at all. There’s context in the fall, and with that, there comes a sliver of peace.\nWhen you spend all your time climbing, it’s easy to forget that falling is actually the most natural thing you can do. Next time you’re on your way down, try to make peace with the fall.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nOK — we’ve gone from motivational cat posters to new-age cult speak, so I’ll get to the point. There are a notable number of mountain-based games in the zeitgeist at the moment and I just wanted to shout them out because they’re all pretty incredible in their own ways.\nCairn\nis a climbing simulator, endurance test and survival game in one gorgeous package, complete with music by\nFuri\ncomposer The Toxic Avenger, French artist\nGildaa\n, and Martin Stig Andersen, who did the soundtracks for\nControl\n,\nLIMBO\nand\nINSIDE\n. Climb absolutely anywhere, manage your inventory by shaking your backpack, bandage your wounds, forage for food and sleep under the stars.\nCairn\ncomes from\nFuri\nstudio The Game Bakers and it’s due out on November 5 for PlayStation 5 and Steam; the demo is available on both platforms now.\nBaby Steps\nis a different kind of mountain-scaling game, and one could argue that it doesn’t even belong in the same category as something like\nCairn\n, but I believe you’ll find that it does.\nBaby Steps\nadheres to the established premise of the climbing genre —\nreach the peak\n— and it features a distant mountaintop as the main waypoint for Nate, a lost and lonely man in a gray onesie. Nate is essentially a dude-sized baby learning how to walk, and creators Maxi Boch, Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy are infusing his journey with\nthe appropriate amount\nof hilarity and mechanical intrigue.\nBaby Steps\nis published by Devolver Digital and it’s heading to PC and PS5 on September 23, a date that was\nrecently pushed back\nto avoid the curse of\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n. (More on that below).\nPEAK\nis the thing all the cool kids are playing this summer, and as a fadingly hip not-kid who prefers solo games and familiar FPSes, I can attest it’s entertaining to watch and looks like a lot of fun to play.\nPEAK\nis a co-op climbing game with simple 3D models and deceptively challenging mountains to summit, each with four biomes. The map updates each day so there’s a steady stream of fresh climbing content, and the proximity voice chat works exceptionally well. I particularly like that players get to live on as little ghosts after they die.\nPEAK\ncomes from indie studio Team PEAK and it’s\non Steam for $8\n.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAnd why not, I’ll shout out some other modern, but not as recent, mountain-based favorites of mine:\nJusant\n,\nCeleste\n,\nGIRP\nand\nJourney\nare all pretty spectacular.\nEnjoy the climb — and the fall.\nThe news\nA selection of indie and AA games I’m looking forward to that aren’t\nSilksong\nBaby Steps\nis the latest game to change its release date in order to get out of the way of\nHollow Knight: Silksong\n, which is\ncoming out on September 4\n. Team Cherry dropped the release date in a trailer on August 21 and since then,\nat least eight indie studios\nhave delayed their own games to avoid the\nSilksong\nwindow. It’s lovely to see\nSilksong\nhave its day in the sun, but personally, I’m more interested in playing\nBaby Steps\nin full.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWith that said, here’s a sampling of indie and AA games I’m anticipating that aren’t\nSilksong\n, in no particular order and right off the top of my head:\nBye Sweet Carole\n(October 9, 2025)\nKeeper\n(October 17, 2025)\nReanimal\n(TBA)\nLittle Nightmares III\n(October 9, 2025)\nPlease, Watch the Artwork\n(2025)\nBuilding Relationships\n(2025)\nMixtape\n(2025)\nCrisol: Theater of Idols\n(2025)\nUNBEATABLE\n(November 6, 2025)\nBig Walk\n(2026)\nGrave Seasons\n(2026)\nPetal Runner\n(2026)\nHades 2\n(live in early access, 1.0 imminent)\nPossessor(s)\n(2025)\nNeverway\n(2026)\nDenshattack!\n(2026)\nAbsolum\n(October 9, 2025)\nSkate Story\n(2025)\nCronos: The New Dawn\n(September 5, 2025)\nLumines Arise\n(November 11, 2025)\nRelooted\n(TBA)\nEscape Academy 2: Back 2 School\n(2026)\nBlighted\n(2026)\nAnd obviously,\nBaby Steps\n(September 23, 2025) and\nCairn\n(November 5, 2025).\nA date for\nskate.\nElectronic Arts has revived the Skate series after 15 years, and the (very youthfully styled)\nskate.\nis primed to hit early access on September 16 across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. The new\nskate.\nis a shift for the series: It’s a free, online, open-world experience with microtransactions (but nothing in the pay-to-win realm, according to EA). The early access version will be free, too, of course.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe scariest part of\nSilent Hill f\nmight be its mental health awareness\nYou’ll find this one alongside\nResident Evil Requiem\nand\nPragmata\nin my AAA-inclusive list of games I’m most looking forward to, and Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith’s preview from Gamescom is only making me more stoked on it.\nSilent Hill f\nis set in a remote village in 1960s Japan and stars a schoolgirl named Hinako. Here’s a bit of Mat’s take after a two-hour demo, which involved a scarecrow confrontation and marionette attacks:\nThe latest Silent Hill still has jumpscares, like you’d expect from the horror series, but the setting and game systems are more focused on tension, putting both Hinako and the player under constant duress. A typical health meter is joined by a sanity gauge and even your weapons have limited durability, so you’re forced to pick your fights.\n… The entire experience is drenched in atmosphere, supported by this new sanity system — is there anything more 2025 than a mental health gauge? The constant feeling of isolation (\"Where is everyone?\") and unanswered questions made the demo a persuasive introduction to the game.\nSilent Hill f\nis due out on PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S on September 25, 2025.\nOVERWATCH 2 STADIUM GET'S ITS BIGGEST UDPATE EVER!\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nRemember when I said I liked playing familiar FPSes?\nOverwatch 2\nis my kind of decompression.

The progression 2.0 developer notes are\nhere\n, if you’re interested. Season 18 also brings\nkeyboard and mouse support to consoles\n, but those players will be thrown into the PC matchmaking pool, and introduces the water-bending support hero Wuyang.\nOverwatch 2\nSeason 18 went live today, August 26.

    "topic": "Salesforce builds ‘flight simulator’ for AI agents as 95% of enterprise pilots fail to reach production",
    "source": "Want smarter insights in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders.\nSubscribe Now\nSalesforce\nis betting that rigorous testing in simulated business environments will solve one of enterprise artificial intelligence’s biggest problems: agents that work in demonstrations but fail in the messy reality of corporate operations.\nThe cloud software giant unveiled three major AI research initiatives this week, including\nCRMArena-Pro\n, what it calls a “\ndigital twin\n” of business operations where AI agents can be stress-tested before deployment. The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with widespread AI pilot failures and fresh security concerns following recent breaches that compromised hundreds of Salesforce customer instances.\n“Pilots don’t learn to fly in a storm; they train in flight simulators that push them to prepare in the most extreme challenges,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s chief scientist and head of AI research, during a press conference. “Similarly, AI agents benefit from simulation testing and training, preparing them to handle the unpredictability of daily business scenarios in advance of their deployment.”\nThe research push reflects growing enterprise frustration with AI implementations. A recent\nMIT report\nfound that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing to reach production, while Salesforce’s own studies show that large language models alone achieve only 35% success rates in complex business scenarios.\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits\nPower caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are:\nTurning energy into a strategic advantage\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems\nSecure your spot to stay ahead\n:\nhttps://bit.ly/4mwGngO\nDigital twins for enterprise AI: how Salesforce simulates real business chaos\nCRMArena-Pro\nrepresents Salesforce’s attempt to bridge the gap between AI promise and performance. Unlike existing benchmarks that test generic capabilities, the platform evaluates agents on real enterprise tasks like customer service escalations, sales forecasting, and supply chain disruptions using synthetic but realistic business data.\n“If synthetic data is not generated carefully, it can lead to misleading or over optimistic results about how well your agent actually perform in your real environment,” explained\nJason Wu\n, a research manager at Salesforce who led the CRMArena-Pro development.\nThe platform operates within actual Salesforce production environments rather than toy setups, using data validated by domain experts with relevant business experience. It supports both business-to-business and business-to-consumer scenarios and can simulate multi-turn conversations that capture real conversational dynamics.\nSalesforce has been using itself as “customer zero” to test these innovations internally. “Before we bring anything to the market, we will put innovation into the hands of our own team to test it out,” said\nMuralidhar Krishnaprasad\n, Salesforce’s president and CTO, during the press conference.\nFive metrics that determine if your AI agent is enterprise-ready\nAlongside the simulation environment, Salesforce introduced the\nAgentic Benchmark for CRM\n, designed to evaluate AI agents across five critical enterprise metrics: accuracy, cost, speed, trust and safety, and environmental sustainability.\nThe sustainability metric is particularly notable, helping companies align model size with task complexity to reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance. “By cutting through model overload noise, the benchmark gives businesses a clear, data-driven way to pair the right models with the right agents,” the company stated.\nThe benchmarking effort addresses a practical challenge facing IT leaders: with new AI models released almost daily, determining which ones are suitable for specific business applications has become increasingly difficult.\nWhy messy enterprise data could make or break your AI deployment\nThe third initiative focuses on a fundamental prerequisite for reliable AI: clean, unified data. Salesforce’s\nAccount Matching\ncapability uses fine-tuned language models to automatically identify and consolidate duplicate records across systems, recognizing that “The Example Company, Inc.” and “Example Co.” represent the same entity.\nThe data consolidation work emerged from a partnership between Salesforce’s research and product teams. “What identity resolution in Data Cloud implies is essentially, if you think about something as simple as even a user, they have many, many, many IDs across many systems within any company,” Krishnaprasad explained.\nOne major cloud provider customer achieved a 95% match rate using the technology, saving sellers 30 minutes per connection by eliminating the need to manually cross-reference multiple screens to identify accounts.\nOAuth token theft exposes vulnerabilities in AI-powered customer tools\nThe announcements come amid heightened security concerns following a data theft campaign that affected over 700 Salesforce customer organizations earlier this month. According to Google’s Threat Intelligence Group,\nhackers exploited OAuth tokens\nfrom Salesloft’s Drift chat agent to access Salesforce instances and steal credentials for Amazon Web Services, Snowflake, and other platforms.\nThe breach highlighted vulnerabilities in third-party integrations that enterprises rely on for AI-powered customer engagement. Salesforce has since\nremoved Salesloft Drift\nfrom its AppExchange marketplace pending investigation.\nThe gap between AI demos and enterprise reality is bigger than you think\nThe simulation and benchmarking initiatives reflect a broader recognition that enterprise AI deployment requires more than impressive demonstration videos. Real business environments feature legacy software, inconsistent data formats, and complex workflows that can derail even sophisticated AI systems.\n“The main aspects that we want we were been discussing today is the consistency aspect, so how to ensure that we go from these in a way unsatisfactory performance, if you just plug an LM into an enterprise use cases, into something which is achieves much higher performances,” Savarese said during the press conference.\nSalesforce’s approach emphasizes the need for AI agents to work reliably across diverse scenarios rather than excelling at narrow tasks. The company’s concept of “\nEnterprise General Intelligence\n” (EGI) focuses on building agents that are both capable and consistent in performing complex business tasks.\nAs enterprises continue to invest in AI technologies, the success of platforms like\nCRMArena-Pro\nmay determine whether the current wave of AI enthusiasm translates into sustainable business transformation or becomes another example of technology promise exceeding practical delivery.\nThe research initiatives will be showcased at\nSalesforce’s Dreamforce conference in October\n, where the company is expected to announce additional AI developments as it seeks to maintain its leadership position in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with widespread AI pilot failures and fresh security concerns following recent breaches that compromised hundreds of Salesforce customer instances.\n“Pilots don’t learn to fly in a storm; they train in flight simulators that push them to prepare in the most extreme challenges,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s chief scientist and head of AI research, during a press conference. “Similarly, AI agents benefit from simulation testing and training, preparing them to handle the unpredictability of daily business scenarios in advance of their deployment.”\nThe research push reflects growing enterprise frustration with AI implementations. A recent\nMIT report\nfound that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing to reach production, while Salesforce’s own studies show that large language models alone achieve only 35% success rates in complex business scenarios.\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits\nPower caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

After Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services for confirmation of the ouster, HHS responded with a link to a post on the department's X account. The post states:\nSusan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.\nThe department did not address the circumstances surrounding Monarez's ouster. But\nreporting from The New York Times\nsuggests that she had clashed with US Health Secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by objecting to his changes on the panel of experts that advise the CDC on vaccine policy.\nMonarez was confirmed by the Senate at the end of July in a 51–47 vote along party lines. She was the first nominee for CDC director that was required to go through Senate confirmation following a law mandating it in 2022.\nKennedy swore Monarez into the role on July 31, saying in a statement, \"Dr. Monarez is a public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials. I have full confidence in her ability to restore the CDC’s role as the most trusted authority in public health and to strengthen our nation's readiness to confront infectious diseases and biosecurity threats.\"\nMonarez has a PhD in microbiology and immunology and previously served as the deputy director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) under the Biden administration. She also previously held leadership and advisory roles with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) at HHS, the Department of Homeland Security, the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Security Council.\nA low point for the agency\nAs Ars has reported previously, Monarez quietly helmed the CDC as acting director from January to March of this year but stepped down as required when Donald Trump nominated her for the permanent role. She was Trump's second nominee for the role, with the first being Dave Weldon, whose nomination was abandoned over concerns about his anti-vaccine views.\nMonarez offered a welcome contrast, as her views generally align with the evidence-based public health community, and she has earned support from experts in the field. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health,\ntold NPR\nat the time of her confirmation that Monarez is \"a loyal, hardworking civil servant who leads with evidence and pragmatism and has been dedicated to improving the health of Americans for the entirety of her career.\"\nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told the outlet that Monarez \"values science, is a solid researcher, and has a history of being a good manager. We're looking forward to working with her.\"\nThe reported ouster comes at what feels like a nadir for the CDC. The agency has lost hundreds of staff from layoffs and buyouts. Vital health programs have been shuttered or hampered. Dangerous rhetoric and health misinformation from Kennedy and other health officials in the Trump administration have made once-respected CDC experts feel vilified by the public and targets of hate. Kennedy himself has falsely called the COVID-19 shots the \"deadliest vaccine ever made\" and the CDC a \"cesspool of corruption,\" for example.\nOn August 8,\na gunman warped by vaccine disinformation opened fire on the CDC campus\n. Of nearly 500 shots fired, about 200 struck six CDC buildings as terrified staff dove for safety. One local police officer was killed in the incident. The gunman had specifically targeted the CDC for the shooting and blamed COVID-19 vaccines for his health problems.\nThis post has been updated to include the social media post from HHS and reporting from the New York Times on the circumstances around Monarez's exit.\nBeth Mole\nSenior Health Reporter\nBeth Mole\nSenior Health Reporter\nBeth is Ars Technica’s Senior Health Reporter.

Columbus has expanded 1,800% since 2020, while Austin/San Antonio has grown 500% from a smaller base over the same period.\nThis spread reflects developers seeking new opportunities as established hubs struggle with power constraints and rising costs.\n“The days of build-it-and-they-will-come are long gone. What we’re seeing now is ‘commit-before-it’s-built-or-you-won’t-get-in,’” said Matt Landek, Division President, U.S. Data Center Work Dynamics and the lead of JLL’s Data Center Project Development and Services.\nPower availability has become the defining challenge for data center development, as the average commercial electricity rates have risen nearly 30% since 2020, reaching 9.7 cents per kilowatt-hour.\nDevelopers are increasingly targeting areas such as Salt Lake City and Denver, where rates remain below the national average.\nEven so, the wait time for grid connections is now roughly four years, delaying projects and slowing the pace at which supply can meet demand.\nIndustry analysts argue power is now “the new real estate,” with access to affordable and reliable energy dictating where capacity can expand.\n“Power has become the new real estate. With vacancy effectively at 0%, virtually all absorption is the result of preleasing with delivery times extending beyond 12 months,” said Andrew Batson, Head of U.S. Data Center Research at JLL.\n“The market has been growing at a remarkable 20% CAGR since 2017, and our development pipeline data suggests this pace will continue through 2030, with the colocation market potentially expanding to 42GW of capacity.”\nThis bottleneck may prevent speculative overbuilding but also ensures that shortages will persist for years.\nVia\nHPC Wire\nYou might also like\nHow GenAI complacency is becoming cybersecurity’s silent crisis\nCheck out our pick of the\nbest secure routers\non offer\nWe've rounded up the\nbest portable monitors\navailable now\nEfosa Udinmwen\nFreelance Journalist\nEfosa has been writing about technology for over 7 years, initially driven by curiosity but now fueled by a strong passion for the field.

Kiwi Farms has turned into an organizational hub for\naggressive harassment campaigns\n,\nparticularly against women and trans people\n, that often\nbleed into the real world\n. 4Chan has also spawned massive harassment campaigns like\nGamergate\n, as well as\nracially-motivated mass shootings\n,\nconspiracy theories like QAnon\n.\nBoth 4Chan and Kiwi Farms could face steep fines of up to £18 million if they fail to comply with Ofcom’s requirement that they regularly submit “risk assessment” reports about their userbase, due to their sites being accessible in the U.K. Earlier in August,\nOfcom issued a provisional decision\nstating that there were “reasonable grounds” to believe 4chan was in violation of the requirement. In the filing, their lawyers argue that Ofcom is overreaching its legal authority by trying to apply British law to companies based in the U.S., where their behavior is protected by the U.S. Constitution and the American legal code, and seek to have a U.S. federal judge declare that Ofcom has no jurisdiction in this matter.\n“American citizens do not surrender our constitutional rights just because Ofcom sends us an e-mail,” Byrne said in a statement to reporters.\nThe OSA’s requirements have\ndrawn international backlash\n, as it’s not clear whether sites like Reddit, Bluesky and Wikipedia would be subjected to the same penalties. But the MAGA internet community — the core of the movement backing Donald Trump — has previously argued that the specifically targeted networks that hosted far-right content, and that the Biden administration allowed them to do so.\nThe Trump administration has taken a\nfar more aggressive approach in favor of MAGA internet\n, reportedly threatening countries with higher tariffs unless they roll back online safety laws. In one case, they’ve followed through: last month, Trump issued\nan executive order raising some tariffs on Brazil by 40%\n, citing the country’s legal action against Rumble and Truth Social.\nByrne, who once represented the right-wing social network Parler,\npreviously told\nThe Verge\nthat he’d believed that the Trump administration had tried working diplomatic backchannels in order to get Ofcom to back down. Though there’s no indication that the State Department has intervened, Byrne said that lawyers representing other websites facing similar issues with Ofcom were watching them closely: should 4Chan and Kiwi Farms, of all places, receive legal protection, it would stand to reason that they should, too. “I’m not going to go into details,” he said, “but suffice to say, there are plenty of lawyers interested in taking on Ofcom right now.”\n3\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nTina Nguyen\nClose\nTina Nguyen\nSenior Reporter, Washington\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nTina Nguyen\nPolicy\nClose\nPolicy\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPolicy\nPolitics\nClose\nPolitics\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nPolitics\nSocial Media\nClose\nSocial Media\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSocial Media\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nMicrosoft hosts emergency press conference after protesters ‘storm a building’\nNothing busted using professional photos as Phone 3 samples\nApple’s iPhone 17 launch event is set for September 9th\nMicrosoft locks down a building after protesters get inside president’s office\nDish gives up on becoming the fourth major wireless carrier\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

    "source": "Mobile\nApple iOS 26 public beta 5 is live: Here are all the new iPhone features coming in September\nHere's how you can access the beta OSes for iPhone and iPad, and when you can expect the final release.\nKatie Teague\nSenior Writer\nUpdated\nWed, August 27, 2025 at 10:23 PM UTC\n12 min read\nApple on Tuesday finally announced that its\niPhone 17 event\nwill take place on Tuesday, September 9. So in just under two weeks, we'll get to take a first look at the new\niPhone 17 lineup\n. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see\niOS 26\navailable for download about one week after the event. If you can't wait any longer, you can\ndownload and install\nthe newly released public beta 5 (or\niOS 26 developer beta 8\nfor developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that\ntaking screenshots\nis way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to\nchoose how long you snooze\n. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our\npreview of the iOS 26 public beta release\n, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called\nLiquid Glass\n, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS,\nmacOS\n,\niPadOS\nand the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's\nWWDC keynote\non June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"\nin the coming year\n,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by\nbasing it on third-party artificial intelligence models\nlike OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a\n'stripped-down' AI chatbot\nto rival ChatGPT.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWith each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this\nnew AirPods gesture\nwe're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll\nfreeze your video if it detects nudity\n. With the release of the\niOS 26 developer beta 5\n, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center,\nMacRumors\nreports\n. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are\neligible to download iOS 26\n(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.\nWhat is iOS 26?\nThe current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to\nrestore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring\nfunctionality for certain users in the US. More recently,\nApple released 18.6.2\nto address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6,\nMacRumors reports\n, which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download.\nBut don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 next month. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.\nIt's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)\nWhat is Liquid Glass design?\nLet's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the\nnew Liquid Glass design\nwas the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSo what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"\nnew translucent material\n\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of\nMicrosoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs\nfrom nearly twenty years ago.\nThat said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple\nhas already incorporated some user feedback\ninto the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with\nthe new macOS Tahoe 26\non your desktop.\nWhat are the new and notable features of iOS 26?\niOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:\nPhone app redesign:\nYou'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nLive Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:\niOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.\nPolls in group chats:\nTired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.\nFiltering unknown senders in Messages:\nIf you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.\nVisual Intelligence:\nSimilar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can\nscreenshot it and use Visual Intelligence\nto find those shoes (or similar ones) online.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nPhotos tabs are back:\nFor anyone who's still frustrated with the\nPhotos changes made last year\n, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature:\nA newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the\nFaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature\nthat pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.\nNew lock screen options\n:\nThe iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.\nApple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple)\nNew changes coming to iPadOS 26\nYour iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nMultitasking and real windowing:\nWhen you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.\nVisual update:\nAlong with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.\nNew menu bar:\nWhen you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.\nCheck out our\nfirst impressions of iPadOS 26\n.\nWhat about AirPods?\nAirPods are also getting updated\nwith iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nEnhanced audio recording:\nApple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.\nCamera remote control:\nUsing this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.\nLive translation feature:\nWhile not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods\ncould be coming with iOS 26\n. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages.\nHeart rate monitoring (rumored for now):\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman\nbelieves Apple will introduce new AirPods Pro earbuds this year, which could have heart rate monitoring. It would work with Apple's Health app and other fitness apps that track heart rates.\nWhich iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?\nA few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be\neligible for the iOS 26 update\n.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\niPhone SE (second generation or later)\niPhone 11\niPhone 11 Pro\niPhone 11 Pro Max\niPhone 12\niPhone 12 mini\niPhone 12 Pro\niPhone 12 Pro Max\niPhone 13\niPhone 13 mini\niPhone 13 Pro\niPhone 13 Pro Max\niPhone 14\niPhone 14 Plus\niPhone 14 Pro\niPhone 14 Pro Max\niPhone 15\niPhone 15 Plus\niPhone 15 Pro\niPhone 15 Pro Max\niPhone 16\niPhone 16 Plus\niPhone 16 Pro\niPhone 16 Pro Max\niPhone 16e\nNot listed here are the presumed new\niPhone 17 models\n(or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September.\nHow to install iOS 26 beta\nThe iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the\nApple Beta Software Program\n. If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit\nbeta.apple.com\nand sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free.\nOnce you're in, you can install it by going to\nSettings\n>\nGeneral\n>\nSoftware Update\nand selecting\niOS 26 public beta\n.\nA word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized.\nWhen will the final version of iOS 26 be released?\niOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. Since the iPhone 17 event falls on September 9 this year, it's possible the downloads will hit our phones on September 16.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIf you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's\neverything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more\nduring WWDC.

    "summary": "Mobile\nApple iOS 26 public beta 5 is live: Here are all the new iPhone features coming in September\nHere's how you can access the beta OSes for iPhone and iPad, and when you can expect the final release.\nKatie Teague\nSenior Writer\nUpdated\nWed, August 27, 2025 at 10:23 PM UTC\n12 min read\nApple on Tuesday finally announced that its\niPhone 17 event\nwill take place on Tuesday, September 9. So in just under two weeks, we'll get to take a first look at the new\niPhone 17 lineup\n. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see\niOS 26\navailable for download about one week after the event. If you can't wait any longer, you can\ndownload and install\nthe newly released public beta 5 (or\niOS 26 developer beta 8\nfor developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that\ntaking screenshots\nis way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to\nchoose how long you snooze\n. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our\npreview of the iOS 26 public beta release\n, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called\nLiquid Glass\n, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS,\nmacOS\n,\niPadOS\nand the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's\nWWDC keynote\non June 9.\nAfter overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).\nSiri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern.",

This paradigm shift requires a fundamentally new approach to insider threat defense.”\nExabeam's report noted its findings \"point to a clear and consistent challenge” in which “organizations are aware of insider threats, but most lack the visibility and cross-functional alignment needed to address them effectively.”\n“As AI becomes more embedded in enterprise workflows, the emergence of AI agents adds a new layer of complexity. These agents are not inherently malicious, but their ability to act independently introduces risks that traditional controls may miss.

Gemini Live is best in class\n(Image credit: Future)\nAI voice assistants are everywhere these days, yet we're still waiting for Apple to truly supercharge Siri with Apple Intelligence.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nWhile\nOpenAI's ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode\nis good, it falls short of Google's Gemini Live, which I believe is the best AI-powered voice assistant on smartphones at the moment.\nI like\nGemini Live\nso much, in fact, that I've assigned the voice assistant to my\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n's Action button, using it frequently instead of activating Siri on my device.\nIf Apple is looking to power Siri through an AI model from another tech giant, then Gemini Live is proof that Google is the perfect partner to do so.\nApple has a ready-made Siri replacement staring it in the face, and all it needs is some swanky branding and compliance with Apple's strict privacy vision.\n2. Gemini reads your email and calendar already\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\nOne of the best ways to use Gemini at the moment is by asking it questions based on your other Google services, such as Gmail and Google Calendar.\nAdding Gemini into Siri would allow iPhone users to ask questions about these incredibly popular services, taking us one step closer towards the AI personal assistant everyone hopes for.\nConsidering the AI model is already able to tap into Google services, you'd expect it to be relatively easy for Apple and Google to offer similar abilities with Apple's most popular apps, such as Mail, Notes, and Calendar.\nWhen Apple revealed Apple Intelligence last year, Siri was able to listen to your requests and implement them across iOS. Gemini basically does that on Android already, so why not allow it to do the same on iPhone?\n3. A smooth transition\nThe AI options available are endless, so having some parity between iPhone and Android would actually be a great thing for smartphone users.\nThink about it, Gemini powers the AI in the best flagship Android devices like the\nSamsung S25\nand the\nGoogle Pixel 10\n. But what if a similar experience was bundled into every iPhone, just with a little bit more Apple polish?\nI'd love to use Gemini as my go-to AI assistant on my iPhone, and quite frankly, I already do. However, having it built into Siri would make it feel even more at home on iPhone, and best yet, for consumers, it means the switch to Android or vice versa, from an AI perspective, would be incredibly smooth.\n4. It's ready to go\nI don't know about you, but I'm bored of waiting for a new version of Siri that's capable of what I want from a voice assistant.\nAnd quite frankly, the thought of purchasing an iPhone 17 without any Siri improvements makes me feel a bit sour towards the upcoming iPhone.\nGemini works, and it's already good to go, so adding implementation into Siri and powering Apple's voice assistant with Google's hard work would mean an intelligent Siri sooner rather than later.\nCurrently, I have no hope for an AI-powered Siri by the end of the year, and quite honestly, that's a real disappointment, considering I bought the iPhone 16 Pro Max with the promise of \"AI for the rest of us.\"\nIf Apple opted to use Gemini, we could get the AI Siri we've wanted for what feels like an eternity very soon, and that's only a good thing for Apple users who are getting impatient waiting for a voice assistant that knows what year it is.\n5. There's already a fruitful partnership\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\nGoogle and Apple have been working together for a very long time, with Google Search as the default search engine on\nSafari\n.\nThat relationship could be in jeopardy with a multi-billion-dollar antitrust case soon to be decided in the US. Following that lawsuit, there could be a big shift in iPhone's moving forward, and it might require new agreements between the two companies.\nCould AI and Gemini be at the forefront of the discussions? Gurman says the companies haven't discussed this matter yet, but he believes that \"if Apple and Google come to an agreement, it would be the basis of a new arrangement around search as well.\"\nApple might choose to steer clear of using a Gemini AI model to power Apple Intelligence, but considering what we've seen so far, I hope\nTim Cook\nand co are at least contemplating it.\nYou might also like\nI tried Google's new AI mode powered by Gemini, and it might be the end of Search as we know it\nGoogle previews AI Mode for search, taking on the likes of ChatGPT search and Perplexity\nGoogle Gemini's new model is the brainstorming AI partner you've been looking for\nTOPICS\nAI\nApple\nJohn-Anthony Disotto\nSocial Links Navigation\nSenior Writer AI\nJohn-Anthony Disotto is TechRadar's Senior Writer, AI, bringing you the latest news on, and comprehensive coverage of, tech's biggest buzzword.

That was confirmed in a post on X by\nthe Department of Health and Human Services\n, which is now led by\nlongtime anti-vaccine crusader, Robert F. Kennedy Jr\n. However, Mark Zaid, who said he is one of the lawyers representing Monarez,\nresponded by posting\n, “Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor yet been fired. She will not resign,” and the following statement:\nRelated\nDeath is the policy\nRFK Jr. is coming for your vaccines\nThe Post says Monarez was “pressed for days” by Kennedy about whether she would support reworking the FDA’s policies. The\nPost\nreports that “at least three top CDC officials” have announced plans to resign, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and Debra Houry, chief medical officer.\nAfter\npreviewing the update in May\n, the government removed healthy pregnant people and children from its list of people recommended to receive the covid vaccine, which\nCNN reports has already\nprevented some people from getting vaccinated.\nIn a\ntweet\n, Kennedy claims the actions will “keep vaccines available to people who want them, especially the vulnerable,” however, they could now require millions of Americans to prove they are at risk, putting an additional hurdle in the way of getting vaccinated.\nThe New York Times\nreports\nthat an upcoming CDC decision could impact availability and access at drugstore sites, as laws in some states require the CDC’s recommendation for pharmacy staff to administer the shots.

    "topic": "With India’s corporate banking lagging decades behind consumer fintech, TransBnk raises $25M to bridge the gap",
    "source": "While digitization has transformed banking for Indian consumers, corporate banking has been left in the slow lane — still relying heavily on clunky infrastructure, paper trails, and spreadsheet-heavy workflows.\nTransBnk\nwants to address that gap, and Bessemer Venture Partners has invested in the three-year-old startup in a $25 million round to accelerate its progress.\nOver the past decade, India has experienced a significant boom in consumer fintech, driven by transformative shifts such as the rise of digital payments through the government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and the proliferation of payment aggregators. However, these innovations have done little to enhance the experience for businesses, especially in transaction banking, where payments, collections, and even account statements still rely on manual processes. Business customers often juggle multiple internet banking portals and rely on spreadsheets for reconciliation. This gap persists despite India being the\nworld’s largest small and medium enterprise (SME) market\n, with\nnearly 75 million SMEs\n— all of which would benefit from more modern financial infrastructure.\nThe untapped potential in corporate banking represents a lucrative opportunity. India’s B2B fintech industry is projected to reach a\nmarket size of $20 billion by 2030\n, according to a February 2024 report by Chiratae Ventures and The Digital Fifth. The country is\nalready home to 26 fintech unicorns\nwith a combined market value of $90 billion, per data analyzed by JM Financial last year. However, most of these startups have focused primarily on innovations in payments and lending rather than core banking infrastructure.\nMumbai-based TransBnk, co-founded by former bankers Vaibhav Tambe, Lavin Kotian, Pulak Jain, and Sachin Gupta, positions itself in this space with what it calls a “common operating system” — a single window through which businesses can access the banking ecosystem. It offers a foundational layer of microservices, enabling use cases such as treasury, liquidity, and escrow management to be built upon.\n“During our banking days, we always got a lot of customers asking us for a single, consolidated platform for transaction banking or corporate banking on a single particular stack,” said Tambe, co-founder and CEO, in an interview. “And we thought, let’s take up this challenge… The idea was that can we consolidate and integrate with multiple banks and then create a single platform, be it in the form factors, like the web interface or mobile app, or maybe SDKs, or API?”\nFounded in 2022, the startup says it right now works with 60 banks, with 40 fully integrated into its platform to process transactions, payments, and even the core functionality reconciliation. It also has 220 customers, of which 80% are merchants, including lenders, fintechs, and non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), while the remaining 20% are banks that have white-labeled its software to provide corporate banking services to their customers.\nGlobally, companies like Finastra, Temenos, and Infosys’ Finacle are helping modernize banking through software platforms. In the U.S., players like Treasury Prime offer embedded banking solutions for enterprise customers. But in India, startups in this domain remain few and far between.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

It also requires close relationships with banks to access and build upon their data and workflows.\nOver the past year, TransBnk says that it has grown its revenue more than 12x, reaching around $12 million in annual recurring revenue. The startup says it turned profitable after taxes in February and what it describes as healthy gross margins of roughly 80%. The company states that it enables around 110 million transactions monthly, covering 11,000 bank accounts and utilizing over 1,500 APIs.\nThe Series B funding round, which includes $4 million in secondary, also saw participation from Fundamentum, Arkam Ventures, 8i Ventures, Accion, and Japan’s GMO Venture Partners. The startup plans to expand beyond India and enter markets such as Southeast Asia and the Middle East, continuing to build its infrastructure platform layer. It also intends to expand its reach to sectors including real estate, pharma, and renewable energy, Tambe told TechCrunch.\nWith the latest funding, TransBnk has raised around $26 million in total.

This gap persists despite India being the\nworld’s largest small and medium enterprise (SME) market\n, with\nnearly 75 million SMEs\n— all of which would benefit from more modern financial infrastructure.\nThe untapped potential in corporate banking represents a lucrative opportunity. India’s B2B fintech industry is projected to reach a\nmarket size of $20 billion by 2030\n, according to a February 2024 report by Chiratae Ventures and The Digital Fifth. The country is\nalready home to 26 fintech unicorns\nwith a combined market value of $90 billion, per data analyzed by JM Financial last year. However, most of these startups have focused primarily on innovations in payments and lending rather than core banking infrastructure.\nMumbai-based TransBnk, co-founded by former bankers Vaibhav Tambe, Lavin Kotian, Pulak Jain, and Sachin Gupta, positions itself in this space with what it calls a “common operating system” — a single window through which businesses can access the banking ecosystem.",

As it's less than a previous rumor indicated,\nwhich was 154 CUs\n. However, this is a bit of a 'how long is a piece of string' question as there's a whole load of variables involved, including how much difference the new architecture makes to the overall performance of AMD's next-gen GPUs, and how much cache is used (with some big increases potentially in the cards there, Kepler notes elsewhere).\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nBy submitting your information you agree to the\nTerms & Conditions\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nand are aged 16 or over.\nHowever, all rumors suggest that AMD is making significant changes to the next generation of its Radeon graphics cards, which is why they\nmight adopt\nthe UDNA architecture\nrather than RDNA 5. The 'U' of UDNA refers to a 'unified' architecture, as this would supposedly represent the joining of RDNA (gaming) and CDNA (data center) architectures, all under one umbrella - a huge move.\nSo, in some ways, it makes sense that AMD would be planning a power move in terms of a proper flagship graphics card, given such a major shift in its GPU landscape. And so it's easy to believe that the intention will be to compete with the top-end of\nNvidia\n's GeForce range.\nGenerally speaking, then, trying to pin down the spec of the possible RX 10090 XT (the logical progression for naming, although I think the flagship will be called something entirely different) at this point is a waste of time. That spec is likely to be fluid and changing, anyway, as we are some way off the realization of AMD's next-gen Radeon products (which are slated to arrive late in 2026, if not 2027).\nAll we need to know is that it's looking increasingly like AMD is going to offer a compelling rival to the\nRTX 5090\n(as previous performance estimations have broadly suggested).\nAlthough it is conceivable that Nvidia may have an RTX 6090, or equivalent, on the table by the time the next-gen Radeon flagship turns up, Team Red should beat its rival to the punch based on current chatter from the grapevine. And indeed, maybe this could spur Nvidia into making an RTX 5090 Super, but I'm getting carried away with the wild speculation (and besides, such a GPU would cut into the supply of chips that Team Green could use for much more profitable AI graphics cards).\nSuffice it to say that AMD is looking towards producing a very powerful GPU with its next-gen range, one that'll please enthusiast gamers with plenty of money to spend - and Nvidia will have to sit up and take notice of that, should these rumors pan out. Especially if AMD can undercut with pricing, which shouldn't be too big an ask given how much Nvidia demands for its top dog GeForce graphics card.\nYou might also like\nThe best AMD graphics card in 2025: top GPUs from Team Red\nThe GPU market is an absolute mess right now, and I don't blame console players for staying away\nTop gaming PCs: great rigs for serious PC gaming\nSee more Computing News\nTOPICS\nAMD\nDarren Allan\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

    "source": "The Trump administration seems intent on controlling Intel’s ability to make key business decisions around its floundering foundry business unit. According to reporting from the Financial Times, at a Deutsche Bank conference on Thursday, Intel’s CFO David Zinsner shared new details about the company’s recent deal with the Trump administration, which gave the U.S. government a 10% equity stake. The deal was structured in a way to penalize Intel if it spins out its foundry business unit, which makes custom chips for outside customers, within the next few years. Last week’s deal included a five-year warrant that would allow the U.S. government to take an additional 5% of Intel, at $20 a share, if the company held less than 51% equity in its foundry business. Zinsner said he expects that warrant to expire. “I think from the government’s perspective, they were aligned with that; they didn’t want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody,” he said. Zinsner added that the company received $5.7 billion in cash on Wednesday, as a result of last week’s deal, according to Reuters. (That cash comes from the remaining grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act.)

But there were a number of mammoth species, including less furry ones that inhabited temperate regions. And the furry ones include at least three species: the Eurasian steppe mammoth, the Arctic-specializing woolly mammoth, and the late-evolving North America-only Columbian mammoth. Because these species inhabited the Arctic, it has been remarkably easy to obtain DNA from them, providing a genetic picture of their relations. The DNA suggests that the woolly mammoth is an offshoot of the steppe mammoth lineage, and was the first to migrate into North America. But the Columbian mammoth was a bit of an enigma; some genetic data suggested it was also a steppe offshoot, while other samples indicated it might be a woolly/steppe hybrid. But all of that data came from animals living in colder environments. In contrast, the Columbian mammoth ranged as far south as Central America. And now, a group of researchers has managed to obtain a bit of genetic information from bones found in the Basin of Mexico, which includes Mexico City.

In his short time at Meta, according to those sources, Mayer oversaw AI data operations teams but wasn’t part of the company’s TBD Labs — the core unit within Meta tasked with building AI superintelligence, where top AI researchers from OpenAI have landed.\nHowever, Mayer disputes some details about his role, telling TechCrunch that his initial position was “to help set up the lab, with whatever was needed” rather than data, and that he was “part of TBD Labs from day one” rather than being excluded from the core AI unit. Mayer also clarified that he “did not report directly to [Wang]” and was “very happy” with his Meta experience.\nBeyond the personnel changes, Meta’s relationship with Scale AI appears to be shifting. TBD Labs is working with third-party data labeling vendors other than Scale AI to train its upcoming AI models, according to five people familiar with the matter. Those third-party vendors include Mercor and Surge, two of Scale AI’s largest competitors, the people said.\nWhile AI labs commonly work with several data labeling vendors – Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge since before TBD Labs was spun up –  it’s rare for an AI lab to invest so heavily in one data vendor. That makes this situation especially notable: even with Meta’s multi-billion-dollar investment, several sources said that researchers in TBD Labs see Scale AI’s data as low quality and have expressed a preference to work with Surge and Mercor.\nScale AI initially built its business on a crowdsourcing model that used a large, low-cost workforce to handle simple data labeling, which is the process of tagging and annotating raw information to train AI models. But as AI models have grown more sophisticated, they now require highly-skilled domain experts—such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists—to generate and refine the high-quality data needed to improve their performance.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Surge and Mercor declined to comment. Asked about Meta’s deepening reliance on competing data providers, a Scale AI spokesperson directed TechCrunch to its\ninitial announcement\nof Meta’s investment in the startup, which cites an expansion of the companies’ commercial relationship.\nMeta’s deals with third-party data vendors likely mean the company is not putting all its eggs in Scale AI, even after investing billions in the startup. The same can’t be said for Scale AI, however. Not long after Meta announced its massive investment with Scale AI,\nOpenAI\nand\nGoogle\nsaid they would stop working with the data provider.\nShortly after losing those customers, Scale AI laid off\n200 employees in its data labeling\nbusiness in July, with the company’s new CEO, Jason Droege, blaming the changes in part on “shifts in market demand.” Droege said Scale AI would staff up in other parts of the business, including government sales — the company just landed a\n$99 million contract\nwith the U.S. Army.\nSome speculated initially that Meta’s investment in Scale AI was really to lure Wang, a founder who has operated in the AI space since Scale AI was founded in 2016 and who appears to be helping Meta to attract top AI talent.\nAside from Wang, there’s an open question around how valuable Scale is to Meta.\nOne current MSL employee says that several of the Scale executives brought over to Meta are not working on the core TBD Labs team.\nMeanwhile, Meta’s AI unit has become increasingly chaotic since bringing on Wang and a wave of top researchers, according to two former employees and one current MSL employee. New talent from OpenAI and Scale AI have expressed frustration with navigating the bureaucracy of a big company, while Meta’s previous GenAI team has seen its scope limited, they said.\nThe tensions indicate that Meta’s largest AI investment to date may be off to a rocky start, despite that it was supposed to address the company’s AI development challenges. After the lackluster launch of\nLlama 4\nin April, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew frustrated with the company’s AI team, one current and one former employee told TechCrunch.\nIn an effort to turn things around and catch up with OpenAI and Google, Zuckerberg rushed to strike deals and launched an aggressive campaign to recruit top AI talent.\nBeyond Wang, Zuckerberg has managed to pull in top AI researchers from\nOpenAI\n, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. Meta has also acquired AI voice startups including\nPlay AI\nand\nWaveForms AI\n, and announced a partnership with the AI image generation startup,\nMidjourney\n.\nTo power its AI ambitions, Meta recently announced several massive data center buildouts across the U.S. One of the largest is a\n$50 billion data center\nin Louisiana called Hyperion, named after a titan in Greek mythology that fathered the God of Sun.\nWang, who’s not an AI researcher by background, was viewed as a somewhat\nunconventional choice\nto lead an AI lab. Zuckerberg reportedly held talks to bring in more traditional candidates to lead the effort, such as OpenAI’s chief research officer,\nMark Chen\n, and tried to acquire the startups of\nIlya Sutskever\nand\nMira Murati\n. All of them declined.\nSome of the new AI researchers recently brought in from OpenAI have\nalready left Meta\n, Wired previously reported. Meanwhile, many longtime members of Meta’s GenAI unit have departed in light of the changes.\nMSL AI researcher Rishabh Agarwal is among the latest,\nposting on X\nthis week that he’d be leaving the company.\n“The pitch from Mark and @alexandr_wang to build in the Superintelligence team was incredibly compelling,” said Agarwal. “But I ultimately choose to follow Mark’s own advice: ‘In a world that’s changing so fast, the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk’.”\nAsked afterward about his time at Meta and what drove his decision to leave, Agarwal declined to comment.\nDirector of product management for generative AI,\nChaya Nayak\n, and research engineer,\nRohan Varma\n, have also announced their departure from Meta in recent weeks. The question now is whether Meta can stabilize its AI operations and retain the talent it needs for its future success.\nMSL has already started working on its next generation AI model. According to reports from\nBusiness Insider\n, it’s aiming to launch it by the end of this year.\nUpdate: This story has been updated with comments from Mayer, who reached out to TechCrunch after publication.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nAI model\n,\nalexandr wang\n,\nMark Zuckerberg\n,\nMeta\n,\nscale\nMaxwell Zeff\nSenior AI Reporter\nMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

Complexity itself has become the enterprise’s greatest cybersecurity vulnerability.\nPlatform vendors have been selling consolidation for years, capitalizing on the chaos and complexity that app and tool sprawl create. As George Kurtz, CEO of\nCrowdStrike\n, explained in a recent\nVentureBeat interview\nabout competing with a platform in today’s mercurially changing market conditions: “The difference between a platform and platformization is execution. You need to deliver immediate value while building toward a unified vision that eliminates complexity.”\nCrowdStrike’s Charlotte AI\nautomates alert triage\nand saves SOC teams over\n40 hours every week\nby classifying millions of detections at\n98%\naccuracy; that equals the output of five seasoned analysts and is fueled by Falcon Complete’s expert-labeled incident corpus.\n“We couldn’t have done this without our Falcon Complete team,” Elia Zaitsev, CTO at CrowdStrike, told\nVentureBeat\nin a recent interview. “They do triage as part of their workflow, manually handling millions of detections. That high-quality, human-annotated dataset is what made over 98% accuracy possible. We recognized that adversaries are increasingly leveraging AI to accelerate attacks.

This spending surge reflects an asymmetric battlefield where attackers deploy gen AI to simultaneously target thousands of employees with personalized campaigns crafted from real-time scraped data.\nAttackers are making the most of the advantages they’re getting from adversarial AI, with speed, stealth and highly personalized, target attacks becoming the most lethal. “For years, attackers have been utilizing AI to their advantage,” Mike Riemer, Field CISO at\nIvanti\n, told\nVentureBeat\n. “However, 2025 will mark a turning point as defenders begin to harness the full potential of AI for cybersecurity purposes.”\nCaption: 55% of security leaders expect budget increases above 5% in 2026, with Asia Pacific organizations leading at 22% expecting increases above 10% versus just 9% in North America. Source:\nForrester’s 2026 Budget Planning Guide\nRegional spending disparities reveal threat landscape variations and how CISOs are responding to them. Asia Pacific organizations lead with\n22%\nexpecting budget increases above 10% versus just\n9%\nin North America.\nCloud security, on-premises technology and security awareness training\ntop investment priorities globally.\nSoftware dominates budgets as runtime defenses become critical in 2026\nVentureBeat continues to hear from security leaders about how crucial protecting the inference layer of AI model development is. Many consider it the new frontline of the future of cybersecurity. Inference layers are vulnerable to prompt injection, data exfiltration, or even direct model manipulation. These are all threats that demand millisecond-scale responses, not delayed forensic investigations.\nForrester’s latest CISO spending guide underscores a profound shift in cybersecurity spending priorities, with cloud security leading all spending increases at\n12%\n, closely followed by investments in on-premises security technology at\n11%\n, and security awareness initiatives at\n10%\n. These priorities reflect the urgency CISOs feel to strengthen defenses precisely at the critical moment of AI model inference.\n“At Reputation, security is baked into our core architecture and enforced rigorously at runtime,” Carter Rees, Vice President of Artificial Intelligence at\nReputation\n, recently told VentureBeat. “The inference layer, the exact moment an AI model interacts with people, data, or tools, is where we apply our most stringent controls. Every interaction includes authenticated tenant and role contexts, verified in real-time by an AI security gateway.”\nReputation’s multi-tiered approach has become a de facto gold standard, blending proactive and reactive defenses. “Real-time controls immediately take over,” Rees explained. “Our prompt firewall blocks unauthorized or off-topic inputs instantly, restricting tool and data access strictly to user permissions. Behavioral detectors proactively flag anomalies the moment they occur.”\nThis rigorous runtime security approach extends equally into customer-facing systems. “For natural language interactions, our AI only pulls from explicitly customer-approved sources,” Rees noted. “Each generated response must transparently cite its sources. We verify citations match both tenant and context, routing for human review if they do not.”\nQuantum computing’s accelerating risk\nQuantum computing is quickly evolving from a theoretical concern into an immediate enterprise threat. Security leaders now face “harvest now, decrypt later” (HNDL) attacks, where adversaries store encrypted data for future quantum-enabled decryption. Widely used encryption methods like 2048-bit RSA risk compromise once quantum processors reach operational scale with tens of thousands of reliable qubits.\nThe\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nfinalized three critical Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards in August 2024, mandating encryption algorithm retirement by 2030 and full prohibition by 2035. Global agencies, including\nAustralia’s Signals Directorate\n, require PQC implementation by 2030.\nForrester urges organizations to prioritize PQC adoption for protecting sensitive data at rest, in transit, and in use. Security leaders should leverage cryptographic inventory and discovery tools, partnering with cryptoagility providers such as\nEntrust\n,\nIBM\n,\nKeyfactor\n,\nPalo Alto Networks\n,\nQuSecure\n,\nSandboxAQ\n, and\nThales\n. Given quantum’s rapid progression, CISOs need to factor in how they’ll update encryption strategies to avoid obsolescence and vulnerability.\nExplosion of identities is fueling an AI-driven credential crisis\nMachine identities now outnumber human users by a staggering\n45:1 ratio\n, fueling a credential crisis beyond human management. Forrester’s\nguide\nunderscores scaling\nmachine identity management\nas mission-critical to mitigating emerging threats. Gartner forecasts identity security spending to nearly double, reaching\n$47.1 billion by 2028\n.\nTraditional endpoint approaches aren’t capable of slowing down a growing onslaught of adversarial AI attacks. Ivanti’s Daren Goeson recently told VentureBeat: “As these endpoints multiply, so does their vulnerability. Combining AI with\nUnified Endpoint Management\n(UEM) is increasingly essential.”\nIvanti’s\nAI-driven\nVulnerability Risk Rating (VRR)\nillustrates this benefit, enabling organizations to patch vulnerabilities 85% faster by identifying threats traditional scoring methods overlook, making AI-driven credential intelligence enterprise security at scale.\n“Endpoint devices such as laptops, desktops, smartphones, and IoT devices are essential to modern business operations. However, as their numbers grow, so do the opportunities for attackers to exploit endpoints and their applications, ”Goeson explained.  “Factors like an expanded attack surface, insufficient security resources, unpatched vulnerabilities, and outdated software contribute to this rising risk. By adopting a comprehensive approach that combines UEM solutions with AI-powered tools, businesses significantly reduce their cyber risk and the impact of attacks,” Goeson advised VentureBeat during a recent interview.\nDivesting legacy tools continues to accelerate\nForrester saves their immediate call to action in the guide for advising security leaders to begin divesting legacy security tools immediately, with a specific focus on interactive application security testing (IAST), standalone cybersecurity risk-rating (CRR) products, and fragmented Security Service Edge (SSE), SD-WAN, and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions.\nInstead, Forrester advises, security leaders need to prioritize more integrated platforms that enhance visibility and streamline management. Unified Secure Access Service Edge (\nSASE\n) solutions from\nPalo Alto Networks\nand\nNetskope\nnow provide essential consolidation. At the same time, integrated Third-Party Risk Management (\nTPRM\n) and continuous monitoring platforms from\nUpGuard\n,\nPanorays\nand\nRiskRecon\nreplace standalone CRR tools the consulting firm advises.\nAdditionally, automated remediation powered by\nMicrosoft’s MDVM\nwith\nIntune\n,\nTanium’s endpoint management\n, and DevOps-focused solutions like\nMondoo\nhas emerged as a critical capability for real-time threat neutralization.\nCISOs must consolidate security at AI’s inference edge or risk losing control\nConsolidating tools at inference’s edge is the future of cybersecurity, especially as AI threats intensify. “For CISOs, the playbook is crystal clear,” Rees concluded. “Consolidate controls decisively at the inference edge. Introduce robust behavioral anomaly detection. Strengthen Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with provenance checks and defined abstain paths. Above all, invest heavily in runtime defenses and support the specialized teams who operate them. Execute this playbook, and you achieve secure AI deployments at true scale.”\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "source": "Words matter\nThe fight against labeling long-term streaming rentals as “purchases” you “buy”\nNew law emboldens complaints against digital content rentals labled as purchases.\nScharon Harding\n–\nAug 29, 2025 5:51 pm\n|\n100\nCredit:\nGetty\nCredit:\nGetty\nText\n        settings\nStory text\nSize\nSmall\nStandard\nLarge\nWidth\n*\nStandard\nWide\nLinks\nStandard\nOrange\n* Subscribers only\nLearn more\nMinimize to nav\nWords have meaning. Proper word selection is integral to strong communication, whether it's about relaying one’s feelings to another or explaining the terms of a deal, agreement, or transaction.\nLanguage can be confusing, but typically when something is available to \"buy,\" ownership of that good or access to that service is offered in exchange for money. That’s not really the case, though, when it comes to digital content.\nOften, streaming services like Amazon Prime Video offer customers the options to “rent” digital content for a few days or to “buy” it. Some might think that picking \"buy\" means that they can view the content indefinitely. But these purchases are really just long-term licenses to watch the content for as long as the streaming service has the right to distribute it—which could be for years, months, or days after the transaction.\nA lawsuit\n[PDF]\nrecently filed against Prime Video challenges this practice and accuses the streaming service of misleading customers by labeling long-term rentals as purchases. The conclusion of the case could have implications for how streaming services frame digital content.\nNew lawsuit against Prime Video\nOn August 21, Lisa Reingold filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California against Amazon, alleging \"false and misleading advertising.\" The complaint, citing\nPrime Video’s terms of use\n, reads:\nOn its website, Defendant tells consumers the option to 'buy' or 'purchase' digital copies of these audiovisual works. But when consumers 'buy' digital versions of audiovisual works through Amazon’s website, they do not obtain the full bundle of sticks of rights we traditionally think of as owning property. Instead, they receive 'non-exclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicensable, limited license' to access the digital audiovisual work, which is maintained at Defendant’s sole discretion.\nThe complaint compares buying a movie from Prime Video to buying one from a physical store. It notes that someone who buys a DVD can view the movie a decade later, but “the same cannot be said,\" necessarily, if they purchased the film on Prime Video. Prime Video may remove the content or replace it with a different version, such as a shorter theatrical cut.\nAmazon has fought this fight before\nIn 2020, Amanda Caudel filed a similar complaint\n[PDF]\nin the same court as Reingold. Caudel's complaint argued that Amazon “secretly reserves the right to terminate the consumers’ access and use of the Video Content at any time, and has done so on numerous occasions, leaving the consumer without the ability to enjoy their already-bought Video Content.”\nCaudel's case was dismissed\n[PDF]\nin October 2021 with the judge ruling that the plaintiff lacked “standing.”\nCalifornia law reignites debate\nDespite the dismissal of similar litigation years ago, Reingold's complaint stands a better chance due to\na California law\nthat took effect in January banning the selling of a \"digital good to a purchaser with the terms ‘buy,’ ‘purchase,' or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good, or alongside an option for a time-limited rental.”\nThere are some instances where the law allows digital content providers to use words like \"buy.\" One example is if, at the time of transaction, the seller receives acknowledgement from the customer that the customer is receiving a license to access the digital content; that they received a complete list of the license's conditions; and that they know that access to the digital content may be \"unilaterally revoked.\"\nA seller can also use words like \"buy\" if it provides to the customer ahead of the transaction a statement that \"states in plain language that 'buying' or 'purchasing' the digital good is a license,\" as well as online access to terms and conditions, the law states.\nThe California legislation helps strengthen the lawsuit filed by Reingold, a California resident. The case is likely to hinge on whether or not fine print and lengthy terms of use are appropriate and sufficient communication.\nReingold's complaint acknowledges that Prime Video shows relevant fine print below its \"buy\" buttons but says that the notice is “far below the ‘buy movie’ button, buried at the very bottom” of the page and is not visible until “the very last stage of the transaction,” after a user has already clicked “buy.”\n“This does not meet the standards set by the statute for a clear and conspicuous notice that the thing they are purchasing is a revocable license to access the digital good,” the complaint reads.\nSpeaking about the case with Ars Technica,\nDanny Karon\n, a\nconsumer attorney\nwho has taught class-action litigation at the University of Michigan Law School and Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, said:\n… Amazon is sure to argue that, never mind its ‘buy’ or ‘purchase’ language, the rest of the story was described (or buried) in its terms and conditions. If plaintiff didn’t want to read her contract, including the small print, that’s on her.\nThe plaintiffs will be challenged to prove that Amazon's communication was ineffective and inaccurate.\n\"One has to prove that when they bought the movie, they were given indication that they 'owned it' in perpetuity and that they were harmed when the movie was taken away,\"\nRahul Telang\n, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College who has researched the digitization of copyrighted industries, told Ars.\n\"I think it is well established that digital products are licensed and they cannot be used as physical products. One has to prove that Amazon provided false information that they were buying a product ...\"\nKaron, pointing to Amazon’s choice of words, told Ars: “I like plaintiff’s chances.” He explained:\nA normal consumer, after whom the California statute at issue is fashioned, would consider ‘buy’ or ‘purchase’ to involve a permanent transaction, not a mere rental, as is occurring here. If the facts are as plaintiff alleges, Amazon’s behavior would likely constitute a breach of contract or statutory fraud.\nThe attorney added that such complaints could be more viable if the content purchased from the plaintiffs was removed from the service.\nThe complaint requests a jury trial and is seeking unspecified damages, including the disgorgement of relevant profits.\nA break in communication\nThe two lawsuits against Prime Video highlight consequential gaps in understanding among people who spend money on digital content. Both cases could contribute to potential changes in how the streaming industry describes digital content transcations moving forward. Prime Video is the target of both suits discussed, but other streaming companies, such as YouTube, also use the word “buy” when selling long-term licenses for digital content.\nStreaming is now the\nmost popular way to watch TV\n, yet many are unaware of what they’re buying. As Reingold's lawsuit points out, paying for content in the streaming era is different from buying media from physical stores. Physical media nets control over your ability to watch stuff for years. But you also had to have retrieved the media from a store (or website) and to have maintained that physical copy, as well the necessary hardware and/or software for playing it. Streaming services can rip purchased content from customers\nin bulk\n, but they also offer access to a much broader library that's instantly watchable with technology that most already have (like a TV and Internet).\nWe can debate the best approach to distributing media. What's clearer is the failure of digital content providers to ensure that customers fully understand they’re paying for access to content, and that this\naccess could be revoked at any time\n.\nThere’s an argument to be made for thoughtful word choices that communicate clearly to customers. Ars asked Amazon if it might change its word choices on Prime Video to avoid the potential confusion embodied by the aforementioned lawsuits. We didn’t receive a response.\nScharon Harding\nSenior Technology Reporter\nScharon Harding\nSenior Technology Reporter\nScharon is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica writing news, reviews, and analysis on consumer gadgets and services.

That’s not really the case, though, when it comes to digital content.\nOften, streaming services like Amazon Prime Video offer customers the options to “rent” digital content for a few days or to “buy” it. Some might think that picking \"buy\" means that they can view the content indefinitely. But these purchases are really just long-term licenses to watch the content for as long as the streaming service has the right to distribute it—which could be for years, months, or days after the transaction.\nA lawsuit\n[PDF]\nrecently filed against Prime Video challenges this practice and accuses the streaming service of misleading customers by labeling long-term rentals as purchases. The conclusion of the case could have implications for how streaming services frame digital content.\nNew lawsuit against Prime Video\nOn August 21, Lisa Reingold filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California against Amazon, alleging \"false and misleading advertising.\" The complaint, citing\nPrime Video’s terms of use\n, reads:\nOn its website, Defendant tells consumers the option to 'buy' or 'purchase' digital copies of these audiovisual works.",

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.\nAs one of the cofounders behind Oculus Story Studio,\nEdward Saatchi\nknows how hard it can be to sell people on new tech that bills itself as revolutionary. Even though Story Studio snagged an Emmy for one of its three animated features, a general lack of public interest in VR movies led\nMeta to shutter Oculus Story Studio\nback in 2017. The VR era has come and gone, but Saatchi is confident that\nShowrunner\n, his new pivot to generative AI that\njust received an influx of cash from Amazon\n, can succeed.\nUnlike a lot of other gen AI-centric entertainment outfits focused on deploying the technology in ways that audiences aren’t necessarily meant to see,\nSaatchi and his team at studio Fable\ndeveloped Showrunner with the intention of people using the platform to generate content tailored to their specific desires. Currently, Showrunner lives on a Discord server where users can generate short animated videos by selecting characters and art styles from a list, and then writing prompts dictating what those characters say and how they interact with the environments around them.\nAfter being told that you want to see Elon Musk and Sam Altman standing in an office break room and having a conversation about turning homelessness into a software as a service, Showrunner will generate a clip that mostly fits that description. Showrunner’s clips are all styled to match the aesthetics of one of the platform’s preset shows, like\nExit Valley\n, a cartoon that appears to be a cross between\nSilicon Valley\nand\nFamily Guy.\nThe characters’ awkward, AI-generated voices are meant to sound like the real people they are based on. And they tend to be animated with an odd stiffness that makes it clear how much of Showrunner’s output is automated by machines rather than crafted by experienced human artists.\nAn Exit Valley clip featuring the likenesses of Donald Trump and Abraham Lincoln.\nFor now, the service is free, but Fable intends to start charging subscribers somewhere between $10–$20 per month at some point in the future. And while Showrunner is currently limited to generating output based on its own catalog of original programming, other studios like Disney have reportedly expressed\ninterest in licensing their IP to the platform\n.\nWhen I spoke with Saatchi recently, he admitted to being a bit too high on his own supply during his time with Oculus and deeply humbled when that version of the company ultimately came to an end. That whiplash left him reconsidering what consumers really want out of their entertainment, and it convinced him that the answers lie in gen AI.\n”You have no idea how arrogant we were right after Meta acquired Oculus, but I remember being in meetings across Hollywood to show off our ideas, and we were just like, ‘You guys are done; we’re taking over,’” Saatchi told me. “But our net impact on the industry was zero in the end, and our revenue from VR movies was probably $10.”\nTo Saatchi’s mind, the big issue with VR was that it kept users in a kind of limbo where they were expected to be both passive and interactive depending on which scenes they were watching. Alternating between those two modes of engagement, Saatchi told me, was part of Oculus’ plan to make its projects feel like crosses between traditional movies and video games. But Saatchi’s own disinterest in watching VR movies was a clear sign to him that the technology was a dead end he should move on from in favor of something more dynamic.\nSaatchi’s interest in gen AI was actually sparked by a technical roadblock he and his collaborators ran into while developing\na VR adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s 2003 children’s book,\nWolves in the Walls\n. In both tellings of the story, a young girl named Lucy lives in constant fear of the wolves living in the walls of her house, while her family insists that the creatures aren’t real. Saatchi and his team wanted their version of Lucy to be able to have fluent conversations with players / viewers as she guided them through the various rooms in her house. But the character was limited to reciting canned bits of dialogue rather than responding with context-specific speech.\nThis hurdle got Saatchi thinking more seriously about how he might be able to build Lucy as a complex “digital being” capable of\nhaving complicated interactions with people\n. That concept put Saatchi on a path to working with a team from OpenAI to see if it was possible. It wasn’t, not really. But the experience of building a slightly more robust Lucy character convinced Saatchi that generative AI could be the key to creating a new kind of entertainment experience.\n“We made Lucy into a character that you can talk to and video chat with,” Saatchi said. “But what we quickly realized is that if you want to make a character truly live — which became our big goal — then you have to build a simulation of their world. They can’t just be a brain in a jar, like one character by themselves. They have to have a family, they have to have a life.”\nThe idea of building simulations — sandboxed virtual environments defined by specific rules — to make AI characters feel more multifaceted by giving them contexts to exist in is what led to Showrunner using its SHOW-1 model to produce a series of\nunlicensed\nSouth Park\nepisodes\n.\nShowrunner could approximate\nSouth Park\n’s visual style and musical cues, but it struggled to re-create the show’s comedic patter or the kind of chemistry between characters that, traditionally, is rooted in human actors’ performances. Also, the ersatz\nSouth Park\njust wasn’t funny, and it felt more like poorly written fanfiction than episodes of television that people might actually want to watch. But to Saatchi, the experiment demonstrated that Showrunner could be fashioned into a service — one dedicated to giving its users a way to prompt up “shows” of their own, one AI generated scene at a time.\nSaatchi speaks about Showrunner the way many pro-gen AI founders do — with an optimistic enthusiasm that doesn’t exactly feel justified when you look at what the platform is currently capable of churning out. He sees it as the “Netflix of AI” and thinks that, with enough users writing the right prompts, it could produce something comparable to\nThe Simpsons\n,\nEuphoria,\nor\nToy Story\n. But Saatchi also believes the real appeal to Showrunner is its ability to create entertainment that’s more interactive than traditional films and shows.\n“We think the\nToy Story\nof AI isn’t going to be a cheaply produced animated movie, it’s going to be something that’s playable,” Saatchi told me. “Most people feel that generative AI is a tool to make the same, but cheaper, and we’re trying to say it’s a new kind of medium. Cinema was not about saving theater owners money; it was highly disruptive and took years to explore as a medium. I feel like the industry is kind of cutting off that exploratory element with generative AI by just shoving it into movies.”\nWhen I brought up the ongoing conversation about gen AI’s potential to put\npeople in creative fields out of work\n, Saatchi said what almost everyone in his position says — that he sees Showrunner as a platform that’s meant to supplement traditionally produced entertainment rather than replace it. He told me that he finds the idea of studios embracing this kind of technology strictly for cost-saving reasons rather grim. Saatchi also stressed that, while Showrunner is built on a number of LLMs, the company works with human artists and animators to develop its visual assets “because something is just clearly lost without that.”\n“I don’t think there’s any papering over the fact that AI is going to cut jobs, but that’s why we’re not very interested in the whole cheaper VFX paradigm that most other folks are going after,” Saatchi explained. “If all that we can do with such a powerful technology is just cut jobs, what was the point? Nobody’s gonna go to the cinema to say, ‘I heard this was the\nToy Story\nof AI. I’ve really got to get my ticket because it’s so cool that they spent so little on this.’”\nWhat Saatchi does think people will be willing to pay for is the ability to generate scenes based on licensed IP. Though Showrunner’s core use case right now is making short, unpolished clips based on Fable’s in-house properties, the company ultimately wants to partner with major studios like Disney to develop branded models that would allow, for example, you to prompt up scenes featuring characters from\nThe Mandalorian.\nThis would “give people a way to create millions of new scenes, thousands of episodes, or even their own movies,” Saatchi reasoned.\n”Our idea would be that, instead of people getting excited about\nstormtroopers in ancient Rome\n, which is, like, a cheap concept, there’s a\nStar Wars\nmodel that 700 people have developed under Dave Filoni’s direction,” Saatchi said. “These models would have real characters and a world that could be explored through prompting, and you could also inadvertently trigger scenes within those worlds in a way that would make it feel as though you’re uncovering something unknown.”\nA clip from Fable’s\nEverything Is Fine\n.\nThroughout our conversation, Saatchi was insistent about Showrunner being a good thing and a revolutionary tool designed to give users a new way of engaging with media. But he agreed when I pointed out that the system he’s describing makes it sound like Showrunner would effectively turn its subscribers into unpaid employees working for some of Hollywood’s biggest and most powerful studios. Studios would own anything generated with Showrunner’s branded models trained on copyrighted IP, and users will eventually have to pay to use the service.\nBut Saatchi stressed that, while Showrunner definitely wants to work with companies like Disney, he is also interested in collaborating with smaller creators who would stand to benefit greatly from the company’s business model. An indie filmmaker could license their new project to Showrunner and subsequently be paid a portion of revenue share based on how many scenes people were generating with the model based on their movie. Saatchi could not give me a timeline on when Showrunner might start trying to establish those kinds of partnerships, but he was bullish about them being part of what makes the platform a boon to independent creators.\n“This could create something where creators can earn money when people are emotionally connected enough to their work that they themselves want to make something with it,” Saatchi said. “Compare that to what creators earn just from people viewing their work online. Yes, there is a kind of ‘we’re all employees of Disney’ element, but from a moral point, I can’t think of a better way to do it.”\nListening to Saatchi describe what he wants Showrunner to become, it actually sounds a bit like Roblox and\nFortnite\n. Not the building or battle royale of it all, but rather the way those games encourage players to create their own maps, share them, and get other people to do the same thing. The Roblox Corporation and Epic have both built platforms where being a consumer can also essentially mean being a worker — one whose labor serves only to contribute to the corporations’ bottom lines.\nBut whereas those games are free to play, Fable very much wants people paying upfront to use Showrunner. If Showrunner were truly capable of conjuring up imaginative, detailed worlds that felt like thoughtful works of art, Saatchi’s pitch might not sound so dubious and mildly exploitative on its face. But what Fable is shopping around right now sounds like yet another attempt at using AI to do something that human artists are already quite capable of doing much, much better.\n15\nComments\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nClose\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nFilm & TV Reporter\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nCharles Pulliam-Moore\nAI\nClose\nAI\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nAI\nEntertainment\nClose\nEntertainment\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nEntertainment\nInterview\nClose\nInterview\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nInterview\nReport\nClose\nReport\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nReport\nTV Shows\nClose\nTV Shows\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTV Shows\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nApple iPhone 17 launch event: What to expect\nWhat’s really happening with the hires at Meta Superintelligence Labs\nMicrosoft AI launches its first in-house models\nThe best Labor Day TV sales\nFramework actually did it: I upgraded a laptop’s entire GPU in just three minutes\nThe Verge Daily\nA free daily digest of the news that matters most.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

The new Inspire Me feature is an AI-fueled discovery tool tuned to your local branch's collection. Following a soft launch this month, it will be officially available in September.\nTo avoid\nthe pitfalls of a full-on chatbot\n, Overdrive is limiting the discovery process of the feature. Instead of typing freely into a prompt box, you'll start by answering several canned preference questions. These include categories (such as fiction and biography), age groups (adult or child) and preset adjectives (like \"clever\" and \"silly\"). You can also let it make recommendations based on your previously saved titles.\nThe AI will then spit out five suggestions from your local library. Overdrive\nsays\nInspire Me prioritizes ebooks and audiobooks that are immediately available. Each recommendation will include a brief explanation of how it aligns with your stated interests.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSome in the library community reacted sharply to the feature. \"Smoke is pouring out of my ears,\" librarian Rachel Storm\nposted\non Bluesky (\nvia\nTechCrunch\n). \"I'm honestly surprised it took this long for them to enshittify Libby,\" Orion Kidder\nresponded\n.\nLibby's AI privacy policy\nstates\nthat Inspire Me only sends tags connected to \"a random selection of titles you have saved\" to the model. The policy says it only sends the book titles, not any other details about you or your device. Overdrive says it designed the feature to minimize energy impact and will monitor its footprint over time.\nAs long as there isn't anything sneaky tucked in beyond that, this sounds like a relatively tame (and potentially handy) use of AI. Then again, I sometimes spend my work hours\nwriting about\nthe\ntruly disturbing shit\n, so take my perspective as you will.\nRegardless of your perspective, the feature will roll out broadly in September. You’ll find it by tapping the Libby icon in the app menu.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",
