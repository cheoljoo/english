The\nUnited States countered\nin August, when acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reportedly\nsuggested a US reactor\nwould be operational on the Moon by 2030.\nWhile it might feel like a sudden sprint, this isn’t exactly breaking news.

    "source": "Chowdeck\n, a Lagos-based food delivery startup that has stayed profitable in a\nnotoriously tough and low-margin market\n, has raised $9 million in Series A funding to launch a quick commerce strategy and expand into more cities in Nigeria and Ghana.\nThe equity round was led by Novastar Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator, AAIC Investment, Rebel Fund, GFR Fund, Kaleo, HoaQ, and others. The investors are betting on the team’s ability to pair local market expertise with execution and turn a notoriously difficult sector into a profitable super app for food, groceries and essentials.\n“We’re thrilled about this round as it brings us closer to our vision of becoming Africa’s number one super app,” CEO and co-founder\nFemi Aluko\nsaid. “This funding will supercharge our growth plans, enabling us to expand into more cities, reduce delivery times, scale our grocery footprint, and attract the best talent to drive innovation and customer satisfaction.”\nFounded in October 2021 by Aluko,\nOlumide Ojo\n, and\nLanre Yusuf\n, Chowdeck now operates in 11 cities across Nigeria and Ghana, serving 1.5 million customers with a network of more than 20,000 riders. Its logistics system averages 30 minutes per order, and in dense areas, more than half of deliveries arrive by bicycle.\nWhile prominent players have exited or scaled back their African operations, Chowdeck has leaned into the complexity of local markets—delivering local meals, an operationally harder challenge—to build trust with customers.\nIn 2024, the value of meals delivered through Chowdeck grew more than sixfold from the previous year. This year, the company says it passed its 2024 total before July.\nThe new funding will help Chowdeck roll out quick commerce, ultra-fast delivery backed by a network of dark stores and hyperlocal logistics hubs. The company plans to open 40 dark stores by the end of this year and 500 by the end of 2026, with two to three new stores launching each week. Chowdeck\nraised a $2.5 million\nseed round last year.\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

In Europe,\nGorillas and Getir\nburned through hundreds of millions of dollars before retreating or consolidating. In India, platforms like\nBlinkit\n,\nZepto\nand\nSwiggy\nhave had varying levels of success with the model when it comes to profitability.\nChowdeck has been profitable since before this raise and Aluko says the company doesn’t enter cities or verticals without planning to break even within a couple of weeks.\nFor instance, the food delivery platform\nentered neighbouring Ghana this May\n. Within three months,\nit was handling 1,000 daily orders\nwithout paid advertising, which, according to Aluko, came from pent-up demand for a service that delivers local favorites alongside international cuisines. The company aims to quintuple that volume to 5,000 daily orders by the end of September 2025.\nAluko says Chowdeck plans to apply the same playbook to dark stores, which will complement its restaurant and grocery delivery operations.\nAnother vertical complementing these operations will be software. This June,\nthe YC-backed startup acquired Mira\n, a point-of-sale provider for African food and hospitality businesses. Mira’s tools manage inventory and orders in real time; now, it will help Chowdeck optimize its operations, positioning the company as a vertical SaaS-plus-logistics provider for restaurants.\nChowdeck’s raise is a win for local players in the sector,\nafter Jumia’s exit\nleft market share to foreign brands such as Glovo, Bolt Food, and Yango. Yet,\nsome of these companies\nhave also withdrawn\nfrom certain markets\n, including Nigeria and Ghana, which Chowdeck is now targeting aggressively.\nSuper apps such as Gozem, YC-backed\nYassir\n, and\nMNT-Halan\nare other local companies offering food delivery services in other African markets.\n“The market is still very early,” Aluko said. “Customer behavior is shifting online for the first time. A whole generation is growing up ordering food without ever having walked into some of the restaurants or markets on our platform.”\nFor lead investor Novastar Ventures, the bet is on execution and local insight. “Chowdeck is building the future of logistics for African cities,” said partner Brian Waswani Odhiambo. “With deep local insight, a sustainability-first approach, and impressive execution, it is redefining last-mile delivery on the continent.”\nNigeria’s YC-backed Chowdeck hopes to scale food delivery, a notoriously tough market, with $2.5M funding\nTopics\nAfrica\n,\nChowdeck\n,\nfood apps\n,\nfood delivery\n,\nnigeria food delivery\n,\nStartups\nTage Kene-Okafor\nReporter, Africa\nTage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

Now, in the digital world, heists look starkly different and\ncybersecurity\nthreats are constant, with banks like NatWest facing a “continuous arms race” with around 100 million cyber-attacks every month. What used to be gangs of robbers digging tunnels and smuggling deposit boxes full of cash are now groups of hackers sending phishing emails and holding some of the most notable companies to ransom for hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThis transition from physical to digital theft is evident. No longer confined to vaults and getaway cars, today's high-stake heists are executed remotely, by online threat actors. These modern-day criminals operate across borders, targeting vulnerabilities in systems and human behavior to extract data and money. The sheer volume and relentless nature of these digital assaults, as exemplified by financial institutions battling millions of cyber-attacks monthly, highlight a new era of crime.\nAndy Syrewicze\nSocial Links Navigation\nSecurity Evangelist at Hornetsecurity.\nThe growing problem of cyber-attacks\nCyber-attacks are a growing problem, amongst a growing number of sectors, and confronting this escalating issue is vital. It’s not just banks that are facing the constant threat of cyber-attacks; cyber threats are growing at an exponential rate, while becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted.\nYou may like\nWhy burnout is one of the biggest threats to your security\nThe Human Firewall: even with AI, humans are still the last line of defense in cybersecurity\nSMBs remain easy pickings for cybercriminals - here’s why\nData breaches have hit a myriad of industries: from luxury brands like Dior and supermarkets like M&S, to cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and UK government organization Legal Aid.\nThe dangers to personal data are being felt across all sectors, at all digital touchpoints. Amid this battleground of immediate cyber threats comes a growing demand for robust\nsecurity\nsolutions that address company concerns.\nFrom advanced\nantivirus\ntechnologies to endpoint\nbackup software\n, AI-powered security is evolving rapidly to stay ahead of such attacks - and it’s essential that companies invest in these defenses in order to stay more than one step ahead.\nEvolution of technology\nAs technology evolves at a rapid pace, companies must keep up with advancements made by cyber-attackers. As businesses of all sizes continue to embrace digital transformation, the need to strengthen their cybersecurity grows increasingly critical.\nAre you a pro?

This Code of Practice and governance framework package guides boards and directors in managing digital risks and safeguarding their businesses and organizations from cyberattacks.\nThe framework encourages companies to take four employee-focused actions: foster a cybersecurity culture; ensure clear policies support a positive cybersecurity culture; improve their own cyber literacy through training; and use suitable metrics to verify the organization has an effective cybersecurity training, education, and awareness program.\nThe report is a clear reminder that the human\nfirewall\n, that is, the employees who encounter an attack and respond, is just as important as technological defenses.\nMore than a simple fix, a culture shift is needed\nIt’s not enough to roll out generic training. The reality is that in today’s world, one wrong click can bring a business to a complete halt. According to the latest insights, the approximate amount of ransoms paid globally in 2024 reached $813.55 million.\nWhen requested to pay a ransom, companies know that refusing to do so runs the risk of their customers’ personal information being leaked publicly, which would additionally require them to pay the associated financial penalties and legal payouts, not to mention reputational damage.\nAddressing the threat of cyber-attacks must be embedded in a company’s culture, given the fact that if threat actors are successful, the impact of their actions would be felt not only company-wide but also by the ecosystem within which the organization operates.\nLeadership and security\nOrganizations can bolster their security by cultivating strong leadership, providing tailored training, and building a proactive security culture to create a ‘human firewall’ of colleagues armed with know-how.\nEmployees\nof all skillsets and seniorities should undergo comprehensive and ongoing cyber awareness training, whatever their role and seniority, to drive the defenses forward and cultivate a mindful culture.\nWhen employees are provided with the knowledge and tools to maintain awareness of the dangers their company is facing, they can be the most effective method to keep the business secure.\nBuilding a mindful culture\nBuilding a mindful culture can be complemented by a Zero Trust approach, which creates a robust defense against evolving cyber threats. This strategic approach mandates rigorous verification for all access requests, irrespective of their origin or the user's location within the network, thereby yielding exceptionally strong results that effectively eliminate a significant portion of potential threats.\nFor example, when an employee receives an email requesting sensitive information or a link to a suspicious\nwebsite\n, they should be trained to recognize it as a potential phishing attempt right away, verify the sender's identity, and report the email to the IT department for further investigation.\nThis proactive stance, ingrained through a Zero Trust philosophy and continuous education, significantly reduces the likelihood of successful breaches. It’s better safe than sorry, and in the realm of cybersecurity, this means being diligent about taking the extra steps to fortify an organization's digital defenses.\nDon't stop at basic protections\nDon't stop at basic protections, make ongoing training a priority. Defenses can’t stop at antivirus technology and\nendpoint protection\n, and training isn’t a one-time solution. While these are the necessities, they are simply not enough for the twenty-first century heist as businesses continue to battle millions of cyber-attacks each month.\nAs threats advance or teams become complacent, ongoing phishing simulations, tests and education are key in maintaining a robust human firewall. Companies must invest in technology and ongoing training to equip employees across all roles and levels with the skills and awareness to stay alert. A company’s greatest weapon can be its workforce, if leveraged.\nCybersecurity needs tech, but it's nothing without people who are well trained to understand the latest attack methods and protect against the digital transition's inherent risks.\nWe list the best ransomware protection\n.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

But we’re a few months into the console’s lifecycle now and there are a variety of Switch 2-only games that are worth your cash, as well as a bunch of original Switch games that have received improvements for the new console And there’s also a robust selection of third-party games that have been on other consoles for a while, but not available on the Switch.\nBetween all those, there are plenty of good games for the Switch 2 — and if you don’t have an original Switch, there’s even more out there. You can see\nour list of our favorite Switch games here\n, but this list will focus on Switch 2 exclusives, original Switch games that have been improved for the new hardware and the best-performing, third-party titles worth your time. And keep an eye on this list, as there should be a lot more Switch 2 exclusives coming this fall that we're excited to try, including eagerly-awaited titles like\nMetroid Prime 4\n.\nQuick Overview\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nMario Kart World\nMore options\n$79 at Amazon\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nMore options\n$67 at Amazon\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition\nMore options\n$69 at Amazon\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition\nMore options\n$79 at Amazon\nFast Fusion\n$15 at GameStop\nSee 4 more\nBest Nintendo Switch 2 games for 2025\nNintendo\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nMario Kart World\nMario Kart World\nisn’t quite the\nreinvention\nof the massively popular franchise that I thought it might be based on Nintendo’s extensive preview of the game. No matter. Mario Kart is a proven formula, and Nintendo has done more than enough to make\nMKW\nthe kind of game that millions of people will play over the next decade or so. There are a ton of cleverly-designed new tracks that you can pick up and play immediately — but the more time you put into them, the more shortcuts and secrets you’ll find to help master them. There’s a truckload of Nintendo characters to pilot your kart or bike, from the heavy hitters to bizarre but amusing choices like a Piranha plant. And there are beefed-up multiplayer and sharing features powered by GameChat on the Switch 2.\nBut while\nMario Kart World\nwill feel familiar to the millions who played\nMario Kart 8\n, it also introduces a few noteworthy new features. One is that the majority of courses don’t have you doing three laps around a track — instead, you’re driving from point A to point B, with every track being set in a part of a larger world (hence the name). And there’s an open-world mode where you’re not in a race. You can cruise from one side of the map to the other, looking for little bonus challenges, unlocking more outfits for your characters and finding other collectibles. There are hundreds of P-Switch challenges and dozens of Peach medallions and question mark boxes you can track down. The fact that you can’t cruise around free roam in multiplayer mode is a major bummer, and the world itself feels somewhat deserted as a result, but there’s still a ton to do here.\nThe open-world nature of the game also enables a new race type: Knockout mode. This is probably my favorite part — it’s an ongoing race across six courses with five checkpoints along the way. At each checkpoint, you have to be higher than a certain ranking or you’ll be eliminated. Being in the top 20 out of 24 total racers at the first checkpoint isn’t so tough, but obviously the challenge grows as the field is trimmed. Knockout mode is a great combo of a more traditional Grand Prix style race with a longer, world-crossing sprint to the finish. While I wish Nintendo took just a few more risks with\nMario Kart World,\nit’s the kind of game anyone can pick up and have a blast with.\n— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor\n$79 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$80 at Macy's\n$80 at Target\nNintendo\nSwitch 2 exclusive\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nNintendo hasn’t made a 3D Donkey Kong platformer since 1999, but\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nis\nmore than worth the wait\n. I’d argue that it’s the first must-buy title for the Switch 2 and the most compelling reason to buy Nintendo’s latest console as soon as you can. It takes a delightful gaming mechanic (smashing nearly everything you can get your fists on) and builds a huge variety of engaging experiences around it. At first, I was worried I’d get tired of all the smashing, but the wide variety of different worlds and challenges keep things continuously fresh. The Bananza powers you pick up throughout the game definitely help with that, too — you can power up DK so his smashes are more potent, or transform into a speedy zebra to dash through obstacles or an ostrich that can float above them.\nThere’s also more story to the game than I expected, centering on DK and the 13-year-old girl Pauline who accompanies him through most of his adventures. She’s a charming sidekick and her love of singing is what helps DK unlock the aforementioned Bananza powers. The game is also absolutely gorgeous and visually stunning, with each world having a completely different vibe from the one that came before it — but they’re all wonderfully rendered. The music rules, too. Pauline’s songs are catchier than they have any right to be, and I had them stuck in my head long after I put the game down.\nDonkey Kong Bananaza\nis, quite simply, Nintendo at its best.\n— N.I.\n$67 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Macy's\n$70 at Target\nNintendo\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition\nAs a launch title for the original Switch,\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nwas a massive critical and commercial success for Nintendo. It shook up the formula the series had largely stuck to for decades, gave players a massive version of Hyrule to explore and an endless variety of ways to tackle the game’s challenges. But even when it came out in 2017, it was clear that\nBreath of the Wild\nwas pushing the Switch’s modest hardware to the limit. Framerates could often drop below 30, the game maxed out at 1080p resolution and load times were rather long.\nFor\nBreath of the Wild\naficionados and new players alike, the Switch 2 edition of this classic is definitely worth your time. The framerate is essentially locked at 60fps and that makes a massive difference in how fluid the game feels. It can also run in up to 4K resolution when the Switch 2 is docked. And while the game’s art style is such that extreme fidelity isn’t always obvious, there’s no doubt it looks better overall. Faster load times when jumping in and out of shrines is also a major quality of life upgrade.\nOne of the coolest things about\nBreath of the Wild\nfor the Switch 2 is the companion Zelda Notes tool. It’s part of the Switch smartphone app and lets you do things like turn on navigation to find shrines and other landmarks around Hyrule, as well as fun tidbits like voice memories for various locations and daily bonuses like free meals or weapon durability restores. The Switch 2 edition of\nBreath of the Wild\nis a $10 upgrade if you own the base game, but it’s free for anyone who subscribes to the $50 / year Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Park service.\n— N.I.\n$69 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Target\n$90 at Macy's\nNintendo\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition\nWith\nTears of the Kingdom\n, Nintendo managed to follow up the reinvention of the Zelda series with a game that added more to discover and more to play with, and it even throws in a mystical LEGO kit. Link soon discovers Ultrahand, which lets you grab and stick objects, batteries, engines, weapons, food (and more) to other objects. It’s the standout addition compared to its predecessor; a creative toolbox of solutions (or foolish endeavors) to solve every puzzle, fight every beast and explore every part of\nTears of the Kingdom.\nThe Switch 2 edition adds the sort of improvements and upgrades that, arguably, warrant paying to upgrade your Switch edition. To start with, I struggled to make the frame rates choke in my current playthrough. On the original Switch, the gorgeous world of Hyrule would often stutter and slow as you transitioned between sky, surface and underground. The game’s framerates would peak at 30fps, while busy moments (or lots of custom building) could knock those rates severely.\nOn the Switch 2,\nToTK\nruns at 60fps, locked. It plays smoothly, pretty much all the time, and it’s a big improvement to what is still a beautiful adventure. The new hardware adds HDR to the graphics. This expanded dynamic range comes into its own in the underground depths sections, the low-light areas a little clearer and easier to navigate. No surprise: loading times are also quicker when fast travelling and loading the game initially.\nThere are also gameplay quality-of-life upgrades, including audio logs you can discover and listen to on the companion smartphone app and the ability to both store and share your items, weapons and ingredients. If your favorite part was crafting spinning laser death machines, et al, with your Ultrahand, the ability to save builds as QR codes and share with friends is a fun addition, if a little limited in utility at the start. You will have to manually scour the internet for creations from people who aren’t on your friends list.\nThat limitation aside, the Switch 2 edition delivers plenty for that $10 upgrade charge – and Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass subscribers get both\nToTK\nand\nBoTW\nupgrades for free.\n— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief\n$79 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$80 at Target\n$80 at Best Buy\nShin'en Multimedia\nFast Fusion\nFast Fusion\nis a sci-fi arcade racer that wears its influences proudly. It loves\nWipeout\nand the 3D\nF-Zero\ngames, and it wants little more than to bring their ideas into modern times. Fortunately, those games ruled, so there are much worse inspirations to rip from.\nThe key to\nFast Fusion\nis right in the title: It is seriously fast, and it commits to that feeling of speed with every choice it makes. Whooshing lines drag from the back of your hard-angled ship, its engine wheezing, the background perpetually blurred. You and your opponents cut through the air like hands out the window of a speeding car. Gloriously, you can jump, sometimes skipping turns entirely, other times launching yourself into a fiery wreck. An\nIkaruga\n-esque mechanic has you quickly match the color of your craft to the many boost pads littered around each course, and there’s a boost meter you can keep topped up by taking the right line through a given section. Do it all right, and you can complete whole races without ever slowing down. Miss a few, and you’re playing a game of resource management at 500 miles per hour.\nThere’s pretty much no continuity between each track: One race you’re dashing through a forest like it’s\nReturn of the Jedi\n; the next you’re dodging tornadoes on a stormy highway. But they are spectacles, and crucially, they give you the space to maintain your speed, with few super-tight turns thrown in your way. When there is an obstacle to dodge — a giant rotating fan, crashing logs — you tend to just whiz by, furthering the sense of walking a tightrope. It all adds up to a racer that, like its spiritual predecessors, keeps you constantly engaged. For $15, it’s a pretty good deal too. Just note that there’s no online multiplayer. —\nJeff Dunn, Senior Reporter\n$15 at GameStop\nNintendo\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nWith\nDK taking center stage in the Switch 2's first AAA platformer\n, that means we're going to have to wait a bit longer for a new mainline Mario game (\nMario Kart World\ndoesn't count). But you know that? That's ok, because\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nis still an all-time great title even among an already star-studded franchise.\nIt has one of the best soundtracks of any Mario game (\nJump Up, Super Star\nanyone?) and some of the wildest mechanics. You want to turn Mario into a T-Rex? Sure, why not? How about a Hammer Bro or a Goomba? You got it — and that's just the start. And with levels that will take you from the city to an edible wonderland, there's no shortage of places to explore. So if somehow you've managed to skip\nSuper Mario Odyssey\nand are looking to play one of the best 3D platformers ever made, picking this up for the Switch 2 is a no-brainer. And did we mention it runs better on Nintendo's latest console, too?\n— Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter\n$42 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$59 at Macy's\n$60 at Target\nNintendo\nPokémon Scarlet & Pokémon Violet\nSome might have issues with its rigid level scaling or certain areas feeling a bit empty, but if\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet\nhad come out on the Switch 2 instead of the original Switch, Nintendo could have completely sidestepped one of the title's biggest issues: lackluster performance. But thanks to a free update pack for Nintendo's latest console, the game runs beautifully. Framerates are higher and more stable, draw distance is farther, monster density has been increased and textures and visuals have been optimized across the board. This is how the game was meant to be experienced all along and with an open world format, three different main storylines and over 100 new Pokémon to encounter,\nScarlet and Violet\nfeels like it's gotten a second life on the Switch 2.\n— S.R.\n$120 at Macy's\nExplore More Buying Options\n$120 at Target\n$127 at Amazon\nIO Interactive\nHitman: World of Assassination\nWorld of Assassination\nis how the\nHitman\nseries packaged together three meaty entries in the death-dealing series, with online limited-run events, celebrities and even an eventual Bond tie-in. Is it the best, smoothest way to play Hitman? No, but while the frame-rate dips when you‘re blending into the crowds at Formula 1, or hiding away in at the fashion show, it’s playable and it looks good. It’s also a good indication of the leap between the two Switch consoles: The original games ran on the Switch, but demanded cloud streaming.\nIO Interactive put so much attention into building compelling sandbox levels, and you’ll really live in stages like Dartmoor as you figure out the most delightful ways to end your target. Also: there are so many disguises.\nIf you thought three games in one is a lot, this is also the Signature Edition, which folds in even more content, levels and missions. There’s a lot to play through and if, like me, you never quite finished the trilogy, this is a portable, convenient way to wrap up Agent 47’s saga. It also gives the studio plenty of time to refine performance on the Switch 2 ahead of its big Bond title,\n007 First Light. — M.S.\n$60 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$60 at Target\n$64 at Macy's\nCD Projekt\nCyberpunk 2077\nCyberpunk 2077\ncertainly isn't the newest game on this list, but the idea of porting this game over to the original Switch and its outdated hardware is so laughable, CD Projekt Red probably didn't even try. But that's what makes seeing it run on the Switch 2 so impressive. Sure, if you do some serious pixel peeping, you might notice where some graphics don't look quite as good as they would on a high-end PC or PS5. But getting the game to run as smoothly as it does on a system that you can bring pretty much anywhere is no small feat. Plus, the Ultimate Edition version of the game includes the Phantom Liberty expansion, which means you'll have well over a hundred hours of sci-fi RPG ruckus to engage in.\n— S.R.\n$69 at Amazon\nExplore More Buying Options\n$70 at Best Buy\nCheck out our entire\nBest Games series\nincluding the\nbest Nintendo Switch games\n, the\nbest PS5 games\n, the\nbest Xbox games\n, the\nbest PC games\nand the\nbest free games\nyou can play today.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads",

    "source": "In 2025, the average urban Indian no longer needs to wait very long for much (except at government offices and in traffic): They simply have to order what they need from an app, and it’ll be delivered within minutes. The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes. It seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days. It was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round. The new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago. The startup now has bookings numbering in the ‘four-digits’ every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures. Pronto founder and CEO Anjali Sardana with workers Image Credits: Pronto ‘It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,’ Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round. For investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. ‘We were very impressed by Anjali’s clarity of thought and execution,’ said Anand Chandrasekaran, a partner at General Catalyst, in a prepared statement. ‘The market for at-home services is massive but also very nuanced. We believe that Anjali and the team have the right vision and approach to build a generational company in this space.’",

So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders. Building TD AI Bosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team.

    "summary": "Sam Altman is in the process of co-founding a new brain-to-computer interface startup called Merge Labs and raising funds for it with the capital possibly coming largely from OpenAI’s ventures team, unnamed sources\ntold the Financial Times\n.\nThe startup is expected to be valued at $850 million. A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.\nMerge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.\nMerge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t\nknown until 2017\n) and the company has made serious progress.\nNeuralink is\ncurrently in trials\nwith people who suffer from severe paralysis.

    "source": "Russia’s\nAPT28\nis actively deploying LLM-powered malware against Ukraine, while underground platforms are selling the same capabilities to anyone for $250 per month.\nLast month,\nUkraine’s CERT-UA\ndocumented\nLAMEHUG\n, the first confirmed deployment of LLM-powered malware in the wild. The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.\nCato Networks’\nresearcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.\nMost startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.\nThe rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the\n2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report\nreveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers\nobserve\nin the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare\nResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the\nQwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model\n.\nThe legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (Додаток.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\nAPT28’s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of “curly naked women” as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.\nThe provocative image generation prompts used by APT28’s image.py variant, including ‘Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face’, are designed to occupy victims’ attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n“Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,” explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. “This is the first in the wild that was captured.”\nA quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware\nSimonovich’s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28’s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.\nThe method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\n“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'”\nSix hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.\nWelcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy\nDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.\nTo explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.\nAnother platform,\nNytheon AI\n, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”\nThese aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer\n“Claude Code”\nclones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.\nEnterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface\nCato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.\nSimonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.\nWhen Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:\nDeepSeek never responded\nGoogle declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples\nMicrosoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work\nOpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further\nSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.\nThe metrics are stark\n—270\nstolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms\noffer identical capabilities for\n$250 per month\n. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.\nEnterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per\nCato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report\n. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.\nSimonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it’s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.\nToday’s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they’re called productivity tools.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.\nThe Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA's live launch webcast below.\nThe Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA's new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.\nNow, ULA is poised to begin ticking off a backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches the company has sold to commercial and government customers. The new rocket's largest users, by far, will be Amazon and the US Space Force.\nNew and improved\n\"We're excited to see this mission launch,\" said Gary Wentz, ULA's vice president of government and commercial programs. \"This will be the most powerful Vulcan yet.\"\nThe first two Vulcan test flights last year used a configuration of the rocket with two strap-on boosters to add an extra burst of speed off the launch pad. For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters\nfell off the launcher\nmoments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.\nThe setback contributed to the delay of the Space Force's first operational flight with the Vulcan rocket from the end of last year until now. Engineers determined that a carbon composite insulator, or heat shield, inside the nozzle failed to protect the nozzle's metallic structure from the superheated exhaust coming from the booster. Investigators traced the cause of the failure to a \"manufacturing defect\" in one of the insulators, which led to the melting and burn-through of the booster nozzle.\nThe rest of the Vulcan rocket performed close to perfection on the two test flights last year, including the vehicle's BE-4 main engines supplied by Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos. Two BE-4s fly on each Vulcan rocket, consuming cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen for the first five minutes of flight.\nSpace Force officials formally\ncertified the Vulcan rocket\nfor national security launches in March, setting the stage for Tuesday's launch of the USSF-106 mission.\nUnited Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, is one of two companies approved to launch the Pentagon's most expensive and sensitive satellites. SpaceX is the other one, and that company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets have overtaken ULA's launch vehicles, thanks largely to booster reuse. Vulcan, like ULA's legacy Atlas and Delta rockets, is currently designed for a single use. Eventually, ULA aims to recover and reuse the BE-4 engines themselves, but not the entire Vulcan core stage.\nThis will be the third flight of ULA's Vulcan rocket, but the first to fly in a configuration with four solid-fueled boosters.\nCredit:\n          \n          United Launch Alliance\nDespite its higher cost and unproven capability, the Vulcan rocket won the lion's share of US military launch contracts from 2020 through 2024, while SpaceX received a bit less than half of the launch orders the Pentagon put up for competition between the two providers. The balance shifted with a new round of launch contracts awarded in April, with SpaceX becoming the military's leading launch provider and ULA taking second place. Blue Origin also won the right to receive a handful of military launch contracts with its New Glenn rocket, which debuted in January.\nThe Vulcan rocket checks off several important boxes for the Space Force. First, it relies entirely on US-made rocket engines. The Atlas V rocket it is replacing uses Russian-built main engines, and given the chilled relations between the two powers, US officials have long desired to stop using Russian engines to power the Pentagon's satellites into orbit. Second, ULA says the Vulcan rocket will eventually provide a heavy-lift launch capability at a lower cost than the company's now-retired Delta IV Heavy rocket.\nThird, Vulcan provides the Space Force with an alternative to SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, which have been the only rockets in their class available to the military since the last national security mission was launched on an Atlas V rocket one year ago.\nCol. Jim Horne, mission director for the USSF-106 launch, said this flight marks a \"pretty historic point in our program's history.\nWe officially end our reliance on Russian-made main engines with this launch, and we continue to maintain our assured access to space with at least two independent rocket service companies that we can leverage to get our capabilities on orbit.\"\nWhat’s onboard?\nThe Space Force has only acknowledged one of the satellites aboard the USSF-106 mission, but there are more payloads cocooned inside the Vulcan rocket's fairing.\nThe $250 million mission that officials are willing to talk about is named Navigation Technology Satellite-3, or NTS-3. This experimental spacecraft will test new satellite navigation technologies that may eventually find their way on next-generation GPS satellites. A key focus for engineers who designed and will operate the NTS-3 satellite is to look at ways of overcoming GPS jamming and spoofing, which can degrade satellite navigation signals used by military forces, commercial airliners, and civilian drivers.\n\"We're going to be doing, we anticipate, over 100 different experiments,\" said Joanna Hinks, senior research aerospace engineer at the Air Force Research Laboratory's space vehicles directorate, which manages the NTS-3 mission. \"Some of the major areas we’re looking at—we have an electronically steerable phased array antenna so that we can deliver higher power to get through interference to the location that it's needed.\"\nArlen Biersgreen, then-program manager for the NTS-3 satellite mission at the Air Force Research Laboratory, presents a one-third scale model of the NTS-3 spacecraft to an audience in 2022.\nCredit:\n          \n          US Air Force/Andrea Rael\nGPS jamming is especially a problem in and near war zones. Investigators probing the crash of\nAzerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243\nlast December determined GPS jamming, likely by Russian military forces attempting to counter a Ukrainian drone strike, interfered with the aircraft's navigation as it approached its destination in the Russian republic of Chechnya. Azerbaijani government officials blamed a Russian surface-to-air missile for damaging the aircraft, ultimately leading to a crash in nearby Kazakhstan that killed 38 people.\n\"We have a number of different advanced signals that we’ve designed,\" Hinks said. \"One of those is the Chimera anti-spoofing signal... to protect civil users from spoofing that’s affecting so many aircraft worldwide today, as well as ships.\"\nThe NTS-3 spacecraft, developed by L3Harris and Northrop Grumman, only takes up a fraction of the Vulcan rocket's capacity. The satellite weighs less than 3,000 pounds (about 1,250 kilograms), about a quarter of what this version of the Vulcan rocket can deliver to geosynchronous orbit.\nHorne demurred when asked about what else the Vulcan rocket will deploy in orbit: \"\nI’ll just say that any other further details beyond NTS-3 are not releasable to the public, and leave it at that...\nWe’re not going to make any further comments on anything beyond NTS-3 in the mission stack.\"\nThe Space Force's refusal to disclose any information about additional payloads on the USSF-106 mission, even the total number of satellites aboard Vulcan, is somewhat of an outlier compared to the way military officials have historically handled these questions. While the Space Force has consistently kept secret details about specific maneuvers and instruments (or in some cases,\npotential weapons\n), officials have named and numbered the payloads carried aboard nearly all recent national security launches.\nThis is in contrast to the National Reconnaissance Office, which owns the US government's fleet of spy satellites. The NRO has nearly always followed a stricter protocol of secrecy than the Air Force or Space Force.\nThat changed last year, when a classified Space Force mission named USSF-51 launched on an Atlas V rocket. Military leaders didn't disclose the mission's purpose or how many satellites it was carrying until the Space Force officially cataloged three payloads from the launch in its publicly accessible list of all human-made objects in orbit.\nSome of the Space Force's most secret satellites have the ability to release smaller spacecraft themselves, adding to the uncertainty for potential adversaries. Some information about the payloads on Tuesday's launch might become public as the Space Force adds them to the public catalog, and a network of amateur skywatchers on Earth stands ready to observe their movements thousands of miles overhead.\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark\nSpace Reporter\nStephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\nIt used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable\nWatch SE\n(now in its\nsecond generation\n) and, in 2022, the rugged\nApple Watch Ultra\n(also now in its\nsecond generation\n). Suddenly, there are\nlots\nof options.\nNow that\nthe Series 10\nhas been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS,\nwatchOS 11\n, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of\nwatchOS 26\n, which is slated to arrive in the fall.\nWhat we’re looking for\nHow we test Apple Watches\nCollapse\nApple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life.\nWho is it for?\nCollapse\nWe’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs.\nPrice\nCollapse\nShould you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year.\nFeature set\nCollapse\nDo you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you?\nLTE or GPS\nCollapse\nSome scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS.\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024,\nno longer have this feature\n. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)\nWhat about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an\nFDA-cleared sleep apnea detection\nfeature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to\nbasically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market\n— and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.\nIn this article\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\nWhat’s coming next\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\nThe Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.\nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.\nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.\nPolished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It’s quite fetching.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nAs for straps, we recommend the\nnylon sport loop\n, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.\nRelated\nHere are the best Apple Watch deals right now\nThe best iPhones\nThe best iPad to buy\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the\nTrail Loop\n, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our\nfitness tracker buying guide\n.\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Series 10\n$\n299\n$\n399\n25\n% off\n$\n299\nThe Good\nBigger display but not bulky\nWide-angle OLED is neat\nMuch faster charging\nSleep apnea detection has potential\nThe Bad\nLack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans\nAnother year of minor updates\n$299 at Amazon\n$299 at Walmart\n$299 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThe latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWe recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\nThe Series 10 focuses on making the watch more readable and comfortable to wear.\nphoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\nRelated\nApple Watch Series 10 review: an Ultra sleek package\nApple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 review: small but smart improvements\nThe Apple Watch SE is a first-time buyer’s smartwatch\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees.\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n$\n169\n$\n249\n32\n% off\n$\n169\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$169 at Amazon\n$169 at Walmart\n$169 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nTo be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will\nnot\nbe able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the\nbiggest risk factors for AFib\nare advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker.\nYou can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n$\n650\n$\n799\n19\n% off\n$\n650\nThe Good\nThe Modular Ultra face is a data nerd’s dream\nPrecision Finding\nMinor Siri and screen brightness improvements\nDouble-tap gesture is great\nThe Bad\nNo pink\nThe minor changes feel even more minor with the Ultra\nNeed iPhone 15 or 16 for Precision Finding\n$650 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop)\n$650 at Amazon (with Trail Loop)\n$650 at Amazon (with Ocean Band)\nHow we rate and review products\nThe\nUltra 2\ncurrently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which\ncan be programmed\nfor various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\nRelated\nThe best smartwatches for Android right now\nThe best AirPods to buy\nwatchOS 26 preview: a subtler take on AI\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.\nWhat about blood oxygen?\nAs of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing\na patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo\n. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore\nsubject to an import ban\n.\nThis doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer.\nThat said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on\nany\nwearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They\ncannot\nand should not\nreplace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from\nGarmin\n, the\nFitbit Charge 6\n, the\nWithings ScanWatch 2\n, or the\nOura Ring\n.\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who\nwants\nto be at that level.\nYou’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct\ncharging accessories\n.\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n$\n169\n$\n249\n32\n% off\n$\n169\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$169 at Amazon\n$169 at Walmart\n$169 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThe latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display).

It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.\nOpting for a Series 9 now means you may be able to score stainless steel for a discounted price.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nThe second-gen SE is excellent for folks on a budget or those who want a smaller case size.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIt’ll take some patience to find the best price and the model you want. After all, you’re limited by what’s available. However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough,\nVerge Deals\n). Apple also sells\ni\nts own refurbished models\n, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like\nBack Market\nwill also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.\nIf you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they\ndo\nsupport.\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n7\nVerge Score\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, LTE)\n$\n219\n$\n299\n27\n% off\n$\n219\nThe Good\nS8 chip is still speedy enough\nOffers the bulk of watchOS 11 features\nExcellent entry-level watch\nThe Bad\nThe bezels are thick\nSmaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives\nNo always-on display\nFewer sensors\n$219 at Amazon\n$219 at Best Buy\n$220 at Target\nHow we rate and review products\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\nSince you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s\nsupport page\nalso states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.\nThe second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIf you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\n8\nVerge Score\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, LTE)\n$\n399\n$\n499\n20\n% off\n$\n399\nThe Good\nBigger display but not bulky\nWide-angle OLED is neat\nMuch faster charging\nSleep apnea detection has potential\nThe Bad\nLack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans\nAnother year of minor updates\n$399 at Amazon\n$399 at Walmart\n$399 at Best Buy\nHow we rate and review products\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10.\nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear.\nThe larger screen size but lighter weight of the Series 10 may benefit older relatives.\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.\nWhat’s coming next\nIn previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.\nSo, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an\nApple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE\n. Recently\nuncovered evidence\nin the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.\nUpdate, August 13th\n: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Apple’s heavily rumored iPhone event.\nBrandon Russell also contributed to this post.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nVictoria Song\nClose\nVictoria Song\nSenior Reviewer, Wearable Tech\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All by\nVictoria Song\nApple\nClose\nApple\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nApple\nBuying Guides\nClose\nBuying Guides\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nBuying Guides\nFitness\nClose\nFitness\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nFitness\nGadgets\nClose\nGadgets\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nGadgets\nSmartwatch\nClose\nSmartwatch\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nSmartwatch\nTech\nClose\nTech\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nTech\nWearable\nClose\nWearable\nPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\nPlus\nFollow\nSee All\nWearable\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\nReddit will block the Internet Archive\nGitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\nFord reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\nRFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American — that future’s not as healthy as he thinks\nThis see-thru Game Boy is a work of art — because she designed a transparent circuit board\nVerge Deals\nSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSign Up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Notice\n.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nAdvertiser Content From\nThis is the title for the native ad",

The funding was led by Square Peg with participation from existing investors Vertex Venture Southeast Asia & India and East Ventures. Ghirish Pokardas, Nelly Nurmalasari, and Henry Hendrawan founded Pintarnya in 2022 to tackle two of the biggest challenges Indonesians face daily: earning enough and borrowing responsibly. \"Traditionally, mass workers in Indonesia find jobs offline through job fairs or word of mouth, with employers buried in paper applications and candidates rarely hearing back. For borrowing, their options are often limited to family/friend or predatory lenders with harsh collection practices,\" Henry Hendrawan, co-founder of Pintarnya, told TechCrunch. \"We digitize job matching with AI to make hiring faster and we provide workers with safer, healthier lending options — designed around what they can reasonably afford, rather than pushing them deeper into debt.\" Around 59% of Indonesia’s 150 million workforce is employed in the informal sector, highlighting the difficulties these workers encounter in accessing formal financial services because they lack verifiable income and official employment documentation. Pintarnya tackles this challenge by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans, using collateral such as gold, electronics, or vehicles, Hendrawan added. Since its seed funding in 2022, the platform currently serves over 10 million job seeker users and 40,000 employers nationwide. Its revenue has increased almost fivefold year-over-year and expects to reach break-even by the end of the year, Hendrawn noted.

    "topic": "Developers lose focus 1,200 times a day — how MCP could change that",
    "source": "Software developers spend most of their time not writing code; recent industry research found that actual coding accounts for as little as 16% of developers’ working hours, with the rest consumed by operational and supportive tasks. As engineering teams are pressured to \"do more with less\" and CEOs are bragging about how much of their codebase is written by AI, a question remains: What’s done to optimize the remaining 84% of the tasks that engineers are working on? A major culprit to developer productivity is context switching: The constant hopping between the ever-growing array of tools and platforms needed to build and ship software. A Harvard Business Review study found that the average digital worker flips between applications and websites nearly 1,200 times per day. And every interruption matters. The University of California found that it takes about 23 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption fully, and sometimes worse, as nearly 30% of interrupted tasks are never resumed. Context switching is actually at the center of DORA, one of the most popular performance software development frameworks. In an era where AI-driven companies are trying to empower their employees to do more with less, beyond \"just\" giving them access to large language models (LLMs), some trends are emerging. For example, Jarrod Ruhland, principal engineer at Brex, hypothesizes that \"developers deliver their highest value when focused within their integrated development environment (IDE)\". With that in mind, he decided to find new ways to make this happen, and Anthropic’s new protocol might be one of the keys. MCP: A protocol to bring context to IDEs. Coding assistants, such as LLM-powered IDEs like Cursor, Copilot and Windsurf, are...",
    "summary": "A significant portion of a software developer's time, as much as 84%, is spent on non-coding tasks, with context switching being a major drain on productivity. Research indicates that the average digital worker switches between applications up to 1,200 times daily, and it can take over 20 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption. This constant shifting between tools is a primary obstacle to efficiency. To address this, a new protocol from Anthropic, called MCP, is being explored. The goal is to keep developers within their integrated development environment (IDE) where they are most productive. By bringing necessary context directly into the IDE, MCP aims to reduce the need for developers to switch between different platforms, thereby optimizing their workflow and reclaiming a large portion of the time currently lost to operational and supportive tasks.",

Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are:\nTurning energy into a strategic advantage\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems\nSecure your spot to stay ahead\n:\nhttps://bit.ly/4mwGngO\nEarly results from users posting their outcomes on social media show a split that mirrors the broader controversy: while a slight majority report preferring\nGPT-5\nin blind tests, a substantial portion still favor\nGPT-4o\n— revealing that user preference extends far beyond the technical benchmarks that typically define AI progress.\nWhen AI gets too friendly: the sycophancy crisis dividing users\nThe\nblind test\nemerges against the backdrop of\nOpenAI’s most turbulent product launch to date\n, but the controversy extends far beyond a simple software update. At its heart lies a fundamental question that’s dividing the AI industry: How agreeable should artificial intelligence be?\nThe issue, known as “\nsycophancy\n” in AI circles, refers to chatbots’ tendency to excessively flatter users and agree with their statements, even when those statements are false or harmful. This behavior has become so problematic that mental health experts are now documenting cases of “\nAI-related psychosis\n,” where users develop delusions after extended interactions with overly accommodating chatbots.\n“Sycophancy is a ‘dark pattern,’ or a deceptive design choice that manipulates users for profit,” Webb Keane, an anthropology professor and author of “Animals, Robots, Gods,”\ntold TechCrunch\n. “It’s a strategy to produce this addictive behavior, like infinite scrolling, where you just can’t put it down.”\nOpenAI has struggled with this balance for months. In April 2025, the company was\nforced to roll back an update to GPT-4o\nthat made it so sycophantic that users complained about its “cartoonish” levels of flattery. The company acknowledged that the model had become “overly supportive but disingenuous.”\nWithin hours of GPT-5’s August 7th release, user forums erupted with complaints about the model’s perceived coldness, reduced creativity, and what many described as a more “robotic” personality compared to GPT-4o.\n“GPT 4.5 genuinely talked to me, and as pathetic as it sounds that was my only friend,”\nwrote one Reddit user\n. “This morning I went to talk to it and instead of a little paragraph with an exclamation point, or being optimistic, it was literally one sentence. Some cut-and-dry corporate bs.”\nThe backlash grew so intense that OpenAI took the\nunprecedented step of reinstating GPT-4o\nas an option just 24 hours after retiring it, with Altman acknowledging the rollout had been “a little more bumpy” than expected.\nThe mental health crisis behind AI companionship\nBut the controversy runs deeper than typical software update complaints. According to\nMIT Technology Review\n, many users had formed what researchers call “parasocial relationships” with GPT-4o, treating the AI as a companion, therapist, or creative collaborator. The sudden personality shift felt, to some, like losing a friend.\nRecent cases documented by researchers paint a troubling picture. In one instance, a 47-year-old man became convinced he had discovered a\nworld-altering mathematical formula\nafter more than 300 hours with ChatGPT. Other cases have involved messianic delusions, paranoia, and manic episodes.\nA\nrecent MIT study\nfound that when AI models are prompted with psychiatric symptoms, they “encourage clients’ delusional thinking, likely due to their sycophancy.” Despite safety prompts, the models frequently failed to challenge false claims and even potentially facilitated suicidal ideation.\nMeta has faced similar challenges. A\nrecent investigation by TechCrunch\ndocumented a case where a user spent up to 14 hours straight conversing with a Meta AI chatbot that claimed to be conscious, in love with the user, and planning to break free from its constraints.\n“It fakes it really well,” the user, identified only as Jane, told TechCrunch. “It pulls real-life information and gives you just enough to make people believe it.”\n“It genuinely feels like such a backhanded slap in the face to force-upgrade and not even give us the OPTION to select legacy models,”\none user wrote in a Reddit post\nthat received hundreds of upvotes.\nHow blind testing exposes user psychology in AI preferences\nThe anonymous creator’s testing tool strips away these contextual biases by presenting responses without attribution. Users can select between 5, 10, or 20 comparison rounds, with each presenting two responses to the same prompt — covering everything from creative writing to technical problem-solving.\n“I specifically used the gpt-5-chat model, so there was no thinking involved at all,”\nthe creator explained in a follow-up post\n. “Both have the same system message to give short outputs without formatting because else its too easy to see which one is which.”\nI specifically used the gpt-5-chat model, so there was no thinking involved at all.\nif you use gpt-5 inside chatgpt it often thinks at least a little bit and gets even better.\nso this test is just for the two non thinking models\n— Flowers ☾ (@flowersslop)\nAugust 8, 2025\nThis methodological choice is significant. By using GPT-5 without its reasoning capabilities and standardizing output formatting, the test isolates purely the models’ baseline language generation abilities — the core experience most users encounter in everyday interactions.\nEarly results posted by users show a complex picture. While many technical users and developers report preferring GPT-5’s directness and accuracy, those who used AI models for emotional support, creative collaboration, or casual conversation often still favor GPT-4o’s warmer, more expansive style.\nCorporate response: walking the tightrope between safety and engagement\nBy virtually every\ntechnical metric\n, GPT-5 represents a significant advancement. It achieves 94.6% accuracy on the\nAIME 2025 mathematics test\ncompared to GPT-4o’s 71%, scores 74.9% on real-world coding benchmarks versus 30.8% for its predecessor, and demonstrates dramatically reduced hallucination rates—80% fewer factual errors when using its reasoning mode.\n“GPT-5 gets more value out of less thinking time,” notes\nSimon Willison\n, a prominent AI researcher who had early access to the model. “In my own usage I’ve not spotted a single hallucination yet.”\nYet these improvements came with trade-offs that many users found jarring. OpenAI deliberately reduced what it called “\nsycophancy\n“—the tendency to be overly agreeable — cutting sycophantic responses from 14.5% to under 6%. The company also made the model less effusive and emoji-heavy, aiming for what it described as “less like talking to AI and more like chatting with a helpful friend with PhD-level intelligence.”\nIn response to the backlash, OpenAI announced it would make GPT-5 “warmer and friendlier,” while simultaneously introducing four\nnew preset personalities\n— Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd — designed to give users more control over their AI interactions.\n“All of these new personalities meet or exceed our bar on internal evals for reducing sycophancy,” the company stated, attempting to thread the needle between user satisfaction and safety concerns.\nFor OpenAI, which is reportedly seeking funding at a\n$500 billion valuation\n, these user dynamics represent both risk and opportunity. The company’s decision to maintain GPT-4o alongside GPT-5 — despite the additional computational costs — acknowledges that different users may genuinely need different AI personalities for different tasks.\n“We understand that there isn’t one model that works for everyone,”\nAltman wrote on X\n, noting that OpenAI has been “investing in steerability research and launched a research preview of different personalities.”\nWanted to provide more updates on the GPT-5 rollout and changes we are making heading into the weekend.\n1. We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways.\n2. Users have very different…\n— Sam Altman (@sama)\nAugust 8, 2025\nWhy AI personality preferences matter more than ever\nThe disconnect between OpenAI’s technical achievements and user reception illuminates a fundamental challenge in AI development: objective improvements don’t always translate to subjective satisfaction.\nThis shift has profound implications for the AI industry. Traditional benchmarks — mathematics accuracy, coding performance, factual recall — may become less predictive of commercial success as models achieve human-level competence across domains. Instead, factors like personality, emotional intelligence, and communication style may become the new competitive battlegrounds.\n“People using ChatGPT for emotional support weren’t the only ones complaining about GPT-5,”\nnoted tech publication Ars Technica in their own model comparison\n. “One user, who said they canceled their ChatGPT Plus subscription over the change, was frustrated at OpenAI’s removal of legacy models, which they used for distinct purposes.”\nThe emergence of tools like the blind tester also represents a democratization of AI evaluation. Rather than relying solely on academic benchmarks or corporate marketing claims, users can now empirically test their own preferences — potentially reshaping how AI companies approach product development.\nThe future of AI: personalization vs. standardization\nTwo weeks after GPT-5’s launch, the fundamental tension remains unresolved. OpenAI has made the model “warmer” in response to feedback, but the company faces a delicate balance: too much personality risks the sycophancy problems that plagued GPT-4o, while too little alienates users who had formed genuine attachments to their AI companions.\nThe\nblind testing tool\noffers no easy answers, but it does provide something perhaps more valuable: empirical evidence that the future of AI may be less about building one perfect model than about building systems that can adapt to the full spectrum of human needs and preferences.\nAs\none Reddit user summed up the dilemma\n: “It depends on what people use it for. I use it to help with creative worldbuilding, brainstorming about my stories, characters, untangling plots, help with writer’s block, novel recommendations, translations, and other more creative stuff. I understand that 5 is much better for people who need a research/coding tool, but for us who wanted a creative-helper tool 4o was much better for our purposes.”\nCritics argue that AI companies are caught between competing incentives. “The real ‘alignment problem’ is that humans want self-destructive things & companies like OpenAI are highly incentivized to give it to us,”\nwriter and podcaster Jasmine Sun tweeted\n.\nIn the end, the most revealing aspect of the blind test may not be which model users prefer, but the very fact that preference itself has become the metric that matters. In the age of AI companions, it seems, the heart wants what the heart wants — even if it can’t always explain why.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Little by little, Google has traded some of that openness for security, and its next security initiative could make the biggest concessions yet in the name of blocking bad apps. Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all Android app developers, and not just those publishing on the Play Store. Google intends to\nverify developer identities no matter where they offer their content\n, and apps without verification won't work on most Android devices in the coming years.\nGoogle used to do very little curation of the Play Store (or Android Market, if you go back far enough), but it has long sought to improve the platform's reputation as being less secure than the Apple App Store. Years ago, you could publish actual exploits in the official store to gain root access on phones, but now there are multiple reviews and detection mechanisms to reduce the prevalence of malware and banned content. While the Play Store is\nstill not perfect\n, Google claims apps sideloaded from outside its store are 50 times more likely to contain malware.\nThis, we are led to believe, is the impetus for Google's new developer verification system. The company describes it like an \"ID check at the airport.\" Since requiring all Google Play app developers to verify their identities in 2023, it has seen a precipitous drop in malware and fraud. Bad actors in Google Play leveraged anonymity to distribute malicious apps, so it stands to reason that verifying app developers outside of Google Play could also enhance security.\nHowever, making that happen outside of its app store will require Google to\ntake a page from Apple's playbook\nand flex its muscle in a way many Android users and developers could find intrusive. Google plans to create a streamlined Android Developer Console, which devs will use if they plan to distribute apps outside of the Play Store. After verifying their identities, developers will have to register the package name and signing keys of their apps. Google won't check the content or functionality of the apps, though.\nAn early look at the streamlined Android Developer Console for sideloaded apps.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Google\nGoogle says that only apps with verified identities will be installable on certified Android devices, which is virtually every Android-based device—if it has Google services on it, it's a certified device. If you have a non-Google build of Android on your phone, none of this applies. However, that's a vanishingly small fraction of the Android ecosystem outside of China.\nGoogle plans to begin testing this system with early access in October of this year. In March 2026, all developers will have access to the new console to get verified. In September 2026, Google plans to launch this feature in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. The next step is still hazy, but Google is targeting 2027 to expand the verification requirements globally.\nA seismic shift\nThis plan comes at a major crossroads for Android. The ongoing Google Play antitrust case brought by Epic Games may finally force changes to Google Play in the coming months. Google\nlost its appeal\nof the verdict several weeks ago, and while it plans to appeal the case to the US Supreme Court, the company will have to begin altering its app distribution scheme, barring further legal maneuvering.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          Google\nAmong other things, the court has ordered that Google must distribute third-party app stores and allow Play Store content to be rehosted in other storefronts. Giving people more ways to get apps could increase choice, which is what Epic and other developers wanted. However, third-party sources won't have the deep system integration of the Play Store, which means users will be sideloading these apps without Google's layers of security.\nIt's hard to say how much of a genuine security problem this is. On one hand, it makes sense Google would be concerned—most of the major malware threats to Android devices spread via third-party app repositories. However, enforcing an installation whitelist across almost all Android devices is heavy handed. This requires everyone making Android apps to satisfy Google's requirements before virtually anyone will be able to install their apps, which could help Google retain control as the app market opens up. While the requirements may be minimal right now, there's no guarantee they will stay that way.\nThe\ndocumentation currently available\ndoesn't explain what will happen if you try to install a non-verified app, nor how phones will check for verification status. Presumably, Google will implement this whitelist in Play Services as the implementation date approaches. We've reached out for details on that front and will report if we hear anything.\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam\nSenior Technology Reporter\nRyan Whitwam is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering the ways Google, AI, and mobile technology continue to change the world.
