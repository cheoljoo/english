Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, went further,\npredicting\nthat AI could be \"10 times bigger than the Industrial Revolution, and maybe 10 times faster.\"\nIntelligence, or at least thinking, is increasingly shared between people and machines. Some people have begun to regularly use AI in their workflows. Others have gone further, integrating it into their cognitive routines and creative identities. These are the \"\nwilling\n,\" including the consultants fluent in prompt design, the product managers retooling systems and those building their own businesses that do everything from coding to product design to marketing.\nFor them, the terrain feels new but navigable. Exciting, even. But for many others, this moment feels strange, and more than a little unsettling. The risk they face is not just being left behind. It is not knowing how, when and whether to invest in AI, a future that seems highly uncertain, and one that is difficult to imagine their place in. That is the double risk of\nAI readiness\n, and it is reshaping how people interpret the pace, promises and pressure of this transition.",
    "summary": "The rapid adoption of AI is causing a 'cognitive migration.' While some professionals are eagerly integrating AI into their workflows and see it as an opportunity, a large portion of the workforce feels unsettled and uncertain. They face the dual risk of not knowing how or when to adapt to an AI-driven future, fearing displacement and struggling to find their place in this new landscape.",

Now, decades later,\nlanding on the Moon\nis old news. The new race is to build there, and doing so hinges on power.\nIn April 2025,\nChina reportedly\nunveiled plans to build a nuclear power plant on the Moon by 2035. This plant would support its planned\ninternational lunar research station\n. The\nUnited States countered\nin August, when acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reportedly\nsuggested a US reactor\nwould be operational on the Moon by 2030.\nWhile it might feel like a sudden sprint, this isn’t exactly breaking news. NASA and the Department of Energy have spent years quietly developing\nsmall nuclear power systems\nto power lunar bases, mining operations, and long-term habitats.\nAs a space lawyer\nfocused on long-term human advancement into space, I see this not as an arms race but as a strategic infrastructure race. And in this case, infrastructure is influence.\nA lunar nuclear reactor may sound dramatic, but it's neither illegal nor unprecedented. If deployed responsibly, it could allow countries to peacefully explore the Moon, fuel their economic growth, and test technologies for deeper space missions. But building a reactor also raises critical questions about access and power.\nThe legal framework already exists\nNuclear power in space\nisn’t a new idea.

    "summary": "A new space race is underway, focused on building lunar infrastructure, with power being a critical component. Both the US and China are planning to build nuclear reactors on the Moon within the next decade. A space lawyer clarifies that this is a strategic infrastructure race, not an arms race, and is permissible under existing space law. Nuclear power is seen as essential for long-term exploration and economic activities on the Moon.",
