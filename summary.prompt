  The most important task is to read contents-today.temp.json and generate contents-today.json.

  Please read the contents-today.temp.json file and create a new contents-today.json file in JSON format based on the following rules. All content in the output file must be in English.

  The fields date, URL, topic, and source are already present in contents-today.temp.json. The source field contains the full context of an article. You need to process this source to
  generate and add two new fields: summary and questions.

  Do not access the URL directly; use the content provided in the source field.

  Here are the rules for each field in the final contents-today.json:
   - date: Use today's date.
   - URL: The URL from the input file.
   - topic: The title of the article. If the topic is missing from the input, extract it from the source text.
   - source: The full text of the article from the URL (with ads removed), as provided in the input file.
   - summary: A summary of the article's content, faithful to the original text, with a maximum length of 2000 characters.
   - questions: A maximum of three questions related to the article's content.
