        "source": "In 2025, the average urban Indian no longer needs to wait very long for much (except at government offices and in traffic): They simply have to order what they need from an app, and it’ll be delivered within minutes. The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes.\nIt seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called\nPronto\n, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days.\nIt was only in May when Pronto\nraised a $2 million seed round\nat a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round.\nThe new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago.\nThe startup now has bookings numbering in the “four-digits” every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures.\nPronto founder and CEO Anjali Sardana with workers\nImage Credits:\nPronto\n“It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,” Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round.\nFor investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. “We were very impressed by Anjali,” said Rahul Garg, a partner at General Catalyst. “Given how young she is, given that she spent a lot of her time in the U.S. after she’s come to India, what she’s been able to achieve, the feedback from supply partners, the feedback from customers, her thought process, and how she wants to build and scale this business, we found it very inspiring.”\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Lightspeed Venture Partners recently backed Snabbit, and IPO-bound Urban Company also offers a similar service.\nGarg told TechCrunch that India has 180–190 million nuclear families who are potential customers for household services, and a semi-skilled and unskilled workforce of 35 million that could tap a $35 billion cumulative wage pool in this space.\n“Whichever way you look at the market, this is large enough for multiple players to build an endurable business,” he said.\nExpansion plans\nPronto now has six hubs in Gurugram, a satellite city of New Delhi, up from two in May. Each of these hubs serves customers within 1.5 miles.\nThe startup initially met 70% to 80% of demand from within 500 meters of households, as its first two hubs were located in densely populated residential areas. It has now set up hubs at intersections so its workers can reach multiple smaller, spread-out sectors quickly.\nPronto App\nImage Credits:\nPronto\nPronto’s primary customers are working professionals, and it is seeing high demand. “Household help is very prevalent in India. And therefore, these are use cases where demand is quite concentrated, even in small catchment areas,” Garg said.\nThe startup now plans to expand both within Gurugram and into new markets, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, and other major cities, in the next 12–18 months.\nPronto has a headcount of 33 people and has around 750 workers signed up on its platform.\nTopics\nbain ventures\n,\nExclusive\n,\nGeneral Catalyst\n,\nGlade Brook Capital\n,\nIndia\n,\npronto\n,\nStartups\nJagmeet Singh\nReporter\nJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders.\nSubscribe Now\nDespite being a highly regulated industry, equity trading has consistently been at the forefront of technological innovations in the financial services sector. However, when it comes to agents and AI applications, many banks\nhave taken\na more cautious approach\nto\nadoption.\nTD Securities\n, the equity and securities trading arm of\nTD Bank\n, rolled out its TD AI Virtual Assistant on July 8\n, aimed toward its front office institutional sales, trading and research professionals to help them manage their workflow.\nTD Securities CIO Dan Bosman told VentureBeat that the virtual assistant’s primary goal is to help front-office equity sales and traders gain client insights and research.\n“The first version of this began as a pilot, which we then subsequently scaled,” Bosman said. “It’s really about accessing that equity research data that our analysts put out and bringing it to the hands of the sales team in a way that’s sales-friendly.”\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits\nPower caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are:\nTurning energy into a strategic advantage\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems\nSecure your spot to stay ahead\n:\nhttps://bit.ly/4mwGngO\nBosman noted that being around a trading floor means being exposed to a lot of the lingo, and the context in which users ask some questions feels very unique. So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders.\nBuilding TD AI\nBosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team. Fortunately, the bank has a platform called TD Invent, where employees can bring ideas and the innovation leadership team can evaluate projects responsibly.\n“Someone in our equity research sales desk came in and pretty much said, I’ve got this idea and brought it to TD Invent,” Bosman said. “What I’ve loved most about this is when you build something super magical, you don’t need to go out and sell or put a face on it. Folks come in and say to us, ‘we want this, we need this or we’ve got ideas,’ and it’s truly the best when we’re able to bring our investment in data, cloud and infrastructure together.”\nTD Security built the TD AI virtual assistant by leveraging\nOpenAI\n’s GPT models. Bosman said TD worked with its technology teams and the Canadian AI company Layer 6, which the bank acquired in 2018, as well as with other strategic partnerships. The assistant integrates with the bank’s cloud infrastructure, allowing it to access internal research documents and market data, such as 13F filings and historical equity data.\nBosman calls TDS AI a Knowledge Management System, a term that generally encompasses its ability to retrieve, through\nretrieval augmented generation (RAG)\nprocesses, aggregate and synthesize information into “concise context-aware summaries and insights” so its sales teams can answer client questions.\nTD AI virtual assistant also gives users access to TD Bank’s foundation model, TD AI Prism.\nThe model,\nlaunched in June\n, is in use throughout the entire bank and not just for TD Securities. During the launch, the bank said TD AI Prism will improve the predictive performance of TD Bank’s applications by processing 100 times more data, replacing its single-architecture models and ensuring customer data stays internal.\n“The development posed unique challenges, as gen AI was relatively new to the organization when the initiative began, requiring careful navigation of governance and controls,” Bosman said. “Despite this, the project successfully brought together diverse teams across the enterprise, fostering collaboration to deliver a cutting-edge solution.”\nHe added that one of the standout features is its text-to-SQL capability, which converts natural language prompts into SQL queries.\nTo train the assistant, Bosman said TD Securities developed optimizations to make the process easier.\n“With patent-pending optimizations in prompt engineering and dynamic few-shot examples retrieval, we successfully achieved the business’s desired performance through context learning,” Bosman said. “As a result, fine-tuning the underlying OpenAI model was not required for interacting with both unstructured as well as tabular datasets.”\nBanks slowly entering the agentic era\nTD Bank and TD Securities, of course, are not the only banks interested in expanding from assistants to AI agents.\nBNY\ntold VentureBeat that it\nbegan offering multi-agent\nsolutions to its sales teams to help answer customer questions, such as those related to foreign currency support. Wells Fargo also saw an increase in the usage of\nits internal AI assistant\n. For its auto sales customers,\nCapital One\nbuilt an agent that\nhelps them sell more cars\n.\nMany of these use cases emerged after months of pilot testing, as is the case in every other industry; however, financial institutions have the additional burden of strict customer data privacy and fiduciary responsibilities.\nTD Securities’ Bosman noted that many employees, even on the bank’s business side, are increasingly familiar with tools like ChatGPT. The challenge with pilot testing assistants and agents lies less in teaching them about the tools, but in establishing best practices for using the assistants, integrating them into existing workflows, understanding their limitations and how humans can provide feedback to mitigate hallucinations.\nEventually, Bosman said the assistant would evolve into something even its users outside of the bank would want to use when interacting with TD Securities.\n“My vision is that we see AI as something that can add value to us, but also to external customers at the bank. Right now, it’s a massive opportunity for us around driving a stronger client experience and delivering a better colleague experience,” Bosman said.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The attacks backdoor computers that open malicious archives attached to phishing messages, some of which are personalized.\nSecurity firm ESET\nsaid Monday\nthat it first detected the attacks on July 18, when its telemetry spotted a file in an unusual directory path. By July 24, ESET determined that the behavior was linked to the exploitation of an unknown vulnerability in WinRAR, a utility for compressing files and has an installed base of about 500 million. ESET notified WinRAR developers the same day, and a fix was released six days later.\nSerious effort and resources\nThe vulnerability seemed to have super Windows powers. It abused\nalternate data streams\n, a Windows feature that allows different ways of representing the same file path. The exploit abused that feature to trigger a previously unknown path traversal flaw that caused WinRAR to plant malicious executables in attacker-chosen files paths %TEMP% and %LOCALAPPDATA%, which Windows normally makes off-limits because of their ability to execute code.\nESET said it has determined that the attacks came from RomCom, its tracking designation for a financially motivated crime group operating out of Russia. The well-resourced group has been active for years in attacks that showcase its ability to procure exploits and execute fairly sophisticated tradecraft. The zero-day the group used is now being tracked as CVE-2025-8088.\n“By exploiting a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR, the RomCom group has shown that it is willing to invest serious effort and resources into its cyberoperations,” ESET’s Anton Cherepanov, Peter Strýček, and Damien Schaeffer wrote. “This is at least the third time RomCom has used a zero-day vulnerability in the wild, highlighting its ongoing focus on acquiring and using exploits for targeted attacks.”\nOddly, RomCom wasn’t the only group exploiting CVE-2025-8088.\nAccording to\nRussian security firm Bi.ZONE, the same vulnerability was being actively exploited by a group it tracks as Paper Werewolf. Also tracked as GOFFEE, the group was also exploiting CVE-2025-6218, a separate high-severity WinRAR vulnerability that received a fix five weeks before CVE-2025-8088 was patched.\nBI.ZONE said the Paper Werewolf delivered the exploits in July and August through archives attached to emails impersonating employees of the All-Russian Research Institute. The ultimate goal was to install malware that gave Paper Werewolf access to infected systems.\nWhile the discoveries by ESET and BI.ZONE were independent of each other, it’s unknown if the groups exploiting the vulnerabilities are connected or acquired the knowledge from the same source. BI.ZONE speculated that Paper Werewolf may have procured the vulnerabilities in a dark market crime forum.\nESET said the attacks it observed followed three execution chains. One chain, used in attacks targeting a specific organization, executed a malicious DLL file hidden in an archive using a method known as\nCOM hijacking\nthat caused it to be executed by certain apps such as Microsoft Edge. It looked like this:\nIllustration of the execution chain installing Mythic Agent.\nCredit:\n                                      ESET\nIllustration of the execution chain installing Mythic Agent.\nCredit:\n\n          \n          ESET\nThe DLL file in the archive decrypted embedded shellcode, which went on to retrieve the domain name for the current machine and compare it with a hardcoded value. When the two matched, the shellcode installed a custom instance of the\nMythic Agent\nexploitation framework.\nA second chain ran a malicious Windows executable to deliver a final payload installing SnipBot, a known piece of RomCom malware. It blocked some attempts at being forensically analyzed by terminating when opened in an empty virtual machine or sandbox, a practice common among researchers. A third chain made use of two other known pieces of RomCom malware, one known as\nRustyClaw\nand the other\nMelting Claw\n.\nWinRAR vulnerabilities have previously been exploited to install malware. One code-execution vulnerability from 2019 came\nunder\nwide\nexploitation\nin 2019 shortly after being patched. In 2023, a WinRAR zero-day was exploited for more than\nfour months\nbefore the attacks were detected.\nBesides its massive user base, WinRAR makes a perfect vehicle for spreading malware because the utility has no automated mechanism for installing new updates. That means users must actively\ndownload\nand install patches on their own. What's more, ESET said Windows versions of the command line utilities UnRAR.dll and the portable UnRAR source code are also vulnerable. People should steer clear of all WinRAR versions prior to 7.13, which, at the time this post went live, was the most current. It has fixes for all known vulnerabilities, although given the seemingly unending stream of WinRAR zero-days, it isn’t much of an assurance.\nDan Goodin\nSenior Security Editor\nDan Goodin\nSenior Security Editor\nDan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he oversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking, encryption, and passwords.

His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\nDid Tesla remotely deactivate a Cybertruck in the middle of a highway because the owner featured it in an unauthorized music video? The story already seemed highly unlikely, and on Monday afternoon, Tesla\ntweeted\nabout the video, saying, “This is fake – that’s not our screen. Tesla does NOT disable vehicles remotely.”\nOn Sunday, Instagram user @bighuey313\nposted a video\nof his supposed deactivated Cybertruck, complete with a flashing red warning message on the truck’s main touchscreen. “Dog wtf my cybertruck just shut off on the freeway! 😡” he wrote in the caption. “Almost just crashed wtf\n@teslamotors\n.”\nImage: Screenshot / @bighuey313\nThe owner also\nposted an image\nof what he claimed was a cease-and-desist letter from Tesla’s vice president of legal affairs, Dinna Eskin. The letter cites “unauthorized use of Tesla’s intellectual property in musical content distributed under your name.”\nThe video quickly went viral on BlueSky, where anti-Elon Musk sentiment has helped fuel nationwide protests against Tesla. But users quickly noticed a number of discrepancies, such as the fact that the letter opens “We represent Tesla” despite being signed by the company’s in-house counsel. The letter also uses Eskin’s old title, “Sr. Director and Deputy General Counsel,”\ndespite her current title of VP\n. And the warning message isn’t formatted like Tesla’s typical in-vehicle alerts and notifications.\nAn X user\nspeculated that the flashing red title was likely just a YouTube video playing on fullscreen to simulate a legitimate error.\nDespite these issues, the video went viral on BlueSky, X, and Reddit — and likely will continue to travel far and wide, confirming many people’s prior opinions about Tesla and Elon Musk.\nUpdate August 11th:\nTesla posted on X\nconfirming the video is fake.\nFollow topics and authors\nfrom this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.\nAndrew J.

        "source": "Mobile\nSmartphones\niPhone 17 release is rumored for September: Everything you need to know about the 'thinnest iPhone ever' and the Apple fall event\nHere are all the iPhone 17 rumors and leaks leading up to the fall announcement.\nAnna Washenko\n,\nWill Shanklin\nUpdated\nMon, August 11, 2025 at 11:28 PM UTC\n9 min read\n(Brian Oh for Engadget)\nThe closer we get to Apple's reveal of the iPhone 17 lineup, the more excited we are to see what's different from the previous iPhones. The newest smartphones will come equipped with the\nlatest iOS 26 features\n. Since we still have to wait at least a month (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.\nWhat are the latest iPhone 17 rumors and reports?\nWill the iPhone 17 Pro have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design? That's the implication from Majin Bu, whom\nMacRumors\nclassifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker.\" The individual\nposted a render on X\ntoday (see below) that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump.\nAgain, this is a render, not a real-world photo, and — like all such stories ahead of the official announcement — should be treated with the usual grain of salt. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.\nHow much will the iPhone 17 cost?\nApple's\nannounced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners\nseems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from\nSwitch consoles\nto\nhigh-end cameras\nto\nSonos speakers\n. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIf prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor\nposted by\nMacRumors\nfrom a leaker known as \"\nInstant Digital\n,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a\nprice increase of $50\n, Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company\ndoubled the default RAM of its Mac computers\nfrom 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.\nWhen will the iPhone 17 series be announced?\nMost years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September.\nMacRumors\nhighlighted\na story originally reported by\niphone-ticker.de\nthat the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.\nIt's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be\nsplit\ninto a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.\nWhat will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?\nDesign leaks suggest that Apple is building an\nultra-thin smartphone\n, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation.\nBloomberg\n's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple,\nreported\nin January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the\niPhone 16e\n. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAn investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu\nindicated\nthat the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.\nAdditionally, an August 4\nMacRumors\nreport\nsays the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the\nKorean-langauge Naver blog\n, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh,\nMacRumors\nnotes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)\nEach new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.\nThe new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the\npurported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\"\nThe pics, highlighted on\nMacRumors\n, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.\nThe iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at\na surprisingly high price point\n, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAt the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity.\nBloomberg\nsaid that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.\nWe've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones.\nMacworld\nreported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.\nOn July 30,\nTom's Guide\nhighlighted an X post from\nSonny Dickson\n— a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned\nMacworld\nstory. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.\nWhat will iOS 26 be like?\nApple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on\niOS 26\n.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nOn the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been\nscaling down\nthe amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.\nThe feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will\nfreeze FaceTime video\nif nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.\niOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the\nnine minute snooze alarm\n.\nThe next iOS is now available as a\npublic beta\n. Here are our initial impressions of the\nLiquid Glass design\nand other new features.\niOS 26 is compatible\nwith all models back through iPhone 11.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nUpdate, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET:\nAdded a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.\nUpdate, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET:\nAdded new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.\nUpdate, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET:\nAdded latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.\nUpdate, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET:\nAdded latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.\nUpdate, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET:\nAdded new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.\nUpdate, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET:\nAdded latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nUpdate, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET:\nAdded latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.\nUpdate, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET:\nAdded details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.\nUpdate, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET:\nAdded details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.\nKatie Teague contributed to this story.\nAdvertisement\nAbout our ads"
